    "target": "The lawsuit arose from a series of government directives beginning in February 2025 aimed at terminating NIH-funded research on topics and populations the administration disfavored, including \u201cgender identity,\u201d \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u201d (DEI), \u201cvaccine hesitancy,\u201d and studies involving certain foreign entities. According to the complaint, these directives followed President Trump\u2019s January 2025 executive orders seeking to end equity-related programs and grants. The plaintiffs alleged that, in response, NIH issued guidance instructing staff to identify and terminate grants in these categories, abruptly ending ongoing projects\u2014many years in progress with substantial financial and time investments\u2014and refusing to consider certain pending applications, including those aimed at diversifying researcher backgrounds.\n\nSince January 2025, NIH has also canceled grant application meetings, indefinitely postponed future ones, and withheld final decisions on applications already approved through the standard review process. The agency sent hundreds of letters to grant recipients at public research institutions in the plaintiff states, terminating previously issued grants because they \u201cno longer effectuate agency priorities.\u201d The plaintiffs argued these actions lacked scientific justification and disregarded established NIH protocols, which normally require non-compliance or cause to justify termination.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, sixteen states filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its Director, and numerous federal agencies responsible for conducting and supporting biomedical research. Judge Brian E. Murphy was initially assigned to the case, but recused himself on May 1, 2025. The case was later reassigned to Judge William G. Young.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Separation of Powers doctrine, and the Spending Clause. They alleged that the defendants\u2019 actions violated the APA by unlawfully withholding or unreasonably delaying agency action, taking action contrary to regulation or statute, and engaging in arbitrary and capricious conduct.\n\nThe plaintiffs initially filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), but on April 8, 2025, filed an assented-to motion withdrawing their TRO request and asking the court to approve a briefing schedule for a motion for a Preliminary Injunction (PI). On April 14, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, along with a motion for a PI. The amended complaint expanded the original claims by directly linking NIH's grant disruptions to executive orders targeting DEI and gender identity. It reframed the case as a challenge to unlawful \"blacklisting directives\" and sought broader relief, including the invalidation of those directives.\n\nA hearing on subject matter jurisdiction was held on May 8. On May 12, the court issued an order affirming its subject matter jurisdiction. On May 29, a joint statement of counsel was filed, outlining an agreed-upon plan for resolving the grant termination issues (Phase 1) and identifying a dispute regarding how to handle the unreasonable delay claims (Phase 2). Each party submitted their respective proposals.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, the court held a Phase 1 bench trial and ruled in favor of the plaintiffs by vacating the challenged government directives. Pursuant to the court's order, the plaintiffs submitted a proposed judgment, which the court reviewed and modified. On June 18, the plaintiffs submitted a revised proposed judgment reflecting the court's modifications for further review.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 Phase 2 unreasonable delay claims, arguing lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. They also requested an expedited response deadline of June 26.\n\nOn June 23, 2025, the court adopted the plaintiffs\u2019 revised proposed judgment, holding that the challenged directives and resulting grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious, and therefore void, unlawful, and without legal effect. The court further ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiffs on Count Three of their amended complaint.\n\nThe defendants appealed the order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that same day and subsequently filed a motion in the district court to stay the judgment pending appeal. The court denied the motion, finding that a stay would result in irreparable harm to the plaintiffs.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, in the First Circuit, defendant-appellants filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, along with a request for an immediate administrative stay. The First Circuit denied the request for immediate relief the following day, stating that it would rule on the broader motion for a stay pending appeal as soon as practicable.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the First Circuit denied to stay the district court\u2019s judgment pending appeal. The court concluded the defendants were unlikely to succeed on the merits: the case involved declaratory and equitable relief under the APA, not a contract dispute for money damages, and agency discretion arguments were forfeited or limited by statutory requirements. The court upheld the district court\u2019s finding that NIH\u2019s grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious, noting undefined prohibited research categories, lack of scientific justification, and interference from a non-NIH group, as well as unaddressed reliance interests of grantees. While the defendants might suffer some financial harm, the court held this was outweighed by irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, including lost research, euthanized animal subjects, and delayed clinical trials. Granting a stay would substantially injure plaintiffs, and the public interest favored enforcing federal law and preserving critical, life-saving research.\n\nOn July 24, 2025, the defendants filed a Supreme Court stay application, arguing that the district court likely lacked jurisdiction and citing Department of Education v. California as precedent. They contended that the Court of Federal Claims, not a district court, was the proper forum for suits seeking government payments and that the district court\u2019s decision amounted to \u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d of the administration\u2019s policy priorities.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court partially granted and partially denied the stay application. The court stayed the district court\u2019s judgments vacating the government\u2019s termination of research grants, reasoning that the court likely lacked jurisdiction over claims based on a contractual \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d which belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the government would face irreparable harm if funds were disbursed. However, the court denied the stay for judgments vacating the NIH guidance documents, finding that the government had failed to show irreparable harm from their vacatur. The decision was closely divided: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh favored granting the stay in full; the Chief Justice and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson favored denying it in full; and Justice Barrett concurred in the partial grant and partial denial.\n\nThe case remains ongoing, with Phase 2 claims regarding unreasonable delays and pending appeals still unresolved.",

    "target": "The lawsuit arose from a series of government directives beginning in February 2025 aimed at terminating NIH-funded research on topics and populations the administration disfavored, including \u201cgender identity,\u201d \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u201d (DEI), \u201cvaccine hesitancy,\u201d and studies involving certain foreign entities. According to the complaint, these directives followed President Trump\u2019s January 2025 executive orders seeking to end equity-related programs and grants. The plaintiffs alleged that, in response, NIH issued guidance instructing staff to identify and terminate grants in these categories, abruptly ending ongoing projects\u2014many years in progress with substantial financial and time investments\u2014and refusing to consider certain pending applications, including those aimed at diversifying researcher backgrounds.\n\nSince January 2025, NIH has also canceled grant application meetings, indefinitely postponed future ones, and withheld final decisions on applications already approved through the standard review process. The agency sent hundreds of letters to grant recipients at public research institutions in the plaintiff states, terminating previously issued grants because they \u201cno longer effectuate agency priorities.\u201d The plaintiffs argued these actions lacked scientific justification and disregarded established NIH protocols, which normally require non-compliance or cause to justify termination.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, sixteen states filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its Director, and numerous federal agencies responsible for conducting and supporting biomedical research. Judge Brian E. Murphy was initially assigned to the case, but recused himself on May 1, 2025. The case was later reassigned to Judge William G. Young.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Separation of Powers doctrine, and the Spending Clause. They alleged that the defendants\u2019 actions violated the APA by unlawfully withholding or unreasonably delaying agency action, taking action contrary to regulation or statute, and engaging in arbitrary and capricious conduct.\n\nThe plaintiffs initially filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), but on April 8, 2025, filed an assented-to motion withdrawing their TRO request and asking the court to approve a briefing schedule for a motion for a Preliminary Injunction (PI). On April 14, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, along with a motion for a PI. The amended complaint expanded the original claims by directly linking NIH's grant disruptions to executive orders targeting DEI and gender identity. It reframed the case as a challenge to unlawful \"blacklisting directives\" and sought broader relief, including the invalidation of those directives.\n\nA hearing on subject matter jurisdiction was held on May 8. On May 12, the court issued an order affirming its subject matter jurisdiction. On May 29, a joint statement of counsel was filed, outlining an agreed-upon plan for resolving the grant termination issues (Phase 1) and identifying a dispute regarding how to handle the unreasonable delay claims (Phase 2). Each party submitted their respective proposals.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, the court held a Phase 1 bench trial and ruled in favor of the plaintiffs by vacating the challenged government directives. Pursuant to the court's order, the plaintiffs submitted a proposed judgment, which the court reviewed and modified. On June 18, the plaintiffs submitted a revised proposed judgment reflecting the court's modifications for further review.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 Phase 2 unreasonable delay claims, arguing lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. They also requested an expedited response deadline of June 26.\n\nOn June 23, 2025, the court adopted the plaintiffs\u2019 revised proposed judgment, holding that the challenged directives and resulting grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious, and therefore void, unlawful, and without legal effect. The court further ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiffs on Count Three of their amended complaint.\n\nThe defendants appealed the order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that same day and subsequently filed a motion in the district court to stay the judgment pending appeal. The court denied the motion, finding that a stay would result in irreparable harm to the plaintiffs.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, in the First Circuit, defendant-appellants filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, along with a request for an immediate administrative stay. The First Circuit denied the request for immediate relief the following day, stating that it would rule on the broader motion for a stay pending appeal as soon as practicable.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the First Circuit denied to stay the district court\u2019s judgment pending appeal. The court concluded the defendants were unlikely to succeed on the merits: the case involved declaratory and equitable relief under the APA, not a contract dispute for money damages, and agency discretion arguments were forfeited or limited by statutory requirements. The court upheld the district court\u2019s finding that NIH\u2019s grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious, noting undefined prohibited research categories, lack of scientific justification, and interference from a non-NIH group, as well as unaddressed reliance interests of grantees. While the defendants might suffer some financial harm, the court held this was outweighed by irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, including lost research, euthanized animal subjects, and delayed clinical trials. Granting a stay would substantially injure plaintiffs, and the public interest favored enforcing federal law and preserving critical, life-saving research.\n\nOn July 24, 2025, the defendants filed a Supreme Court stay application, arguing that the district court likely lacked jurisdiction and citing Department of Education v. California as precedent. They contended that the Court of Federal Claims, not a district court, was the proper forum for suits seeking government payments and that the district court\u2019s decision amounted to \u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d of the administration\u2019s policy priorities.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court partially granted and partially denied the stay application. The court stayed the district court\u2019s judgments vacating the government\u2019s termination of research grants, reasoning that the court likely lacked jurisdiction over claims based on a contractual \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d which belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the government would face irreparable harm if funds were disbursed. However, the court denied the stay for judgments vacating the NIH guidance documents, finding that the government had failed to show irreparable harm from their vacatur. The decision was closely divided: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh favored granting the stay in full; the Chief Justice and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson favored denying it in full; and Justice Barrett concurred in the partial grant and partial denial.\n\nThe case remains ongoing, with Phase 2 claims regarding unreasonable delays and pending appeals still unresolved.",

    "target": "The lawsuit arose from a series of government directives beginning in February 2025 aimed at terminating NIH-funded research on topics and populations the administration disfavored, including \u201cgender identity,\u201d \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u201d (DEI), \u201cvaccine hesitancy,\u201d and studies involving certain foreign entities. According to the complaint, these directives followed President Trump\u2019s January 2025 executive orders seeking to end equity-related programs and grants. The plaintiffs alleged that, in response, NIH issued guidance instructing staff to identify and terminate grants in these categories, abruptly ending ongoing projects\u2014many years in progress with substantial financial and time investments\u2014and refusing to consider certain pending applications, including those aimed at diversifying researcher backgrounds.\n\nSince January 2025, NIH has also canceled grant application meetings, indefinitely postponed future ones, and withheld final decisions on applications already approved through the standard review process. The agency sent hundreds of letters to grant recipients at public research institutions in the plaintiff states, terminating previously issued grants because they \u201cno longer effectuate agency priorities.\u201d The plaintiffs argued these actions lacked scientific justification and disregarded established NIH protocols, which normally require non-compliance or cause to justify termination.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, sixteen states filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its Director, and numerous federal agencies responsible for conducting and supporting biomedical research. Judge Brian E. Murphy was initially assigned to the case, but recused himself on May 1, 2025. The case was later reassigned to Judge William G. Young.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Separation of Powers doctrine, and the Spending Clause. They alleged that the defendants\u2019 actions violated the APA by unlawfully withholding or unreasonably delaying agency action, taking action contrary to regulation or statute, and engaging in arbitrary and capricious conduct.\n\nThe plaintiffs initially filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), but on April 8, 2025, filed an assented-to motion withdrawing their TRO request and asking the court to approve a briefing schedule for a motion for a Preliminary Injunction (PI). On April 14, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, along with a motion for a PI. The amended complaint expanded the original claims by directly linking NIH's grant disruptions to executive orders targeting DEI and gender identity. It reframed the case as a challenge to unlawful \"blacklisting directives\" and sought broader relief, including the invalidation of those directives.\n\nA hearing on subject matter jurisdiction was held on May 8. On May 12, the court issued an order affirming its subject matter jurisdiction. On May 29, a joint statement of counsel was filed, outlining an agreed-upon plan for resolving the grant termination issues (Phase 1) and identifying a dispute regarding how to handle the unreasonable delay claims (Phase 2). Each party submitted their respective proposals.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, the court held a Phase 1 bench trial and ruled in favor of the plaintiffs by vacating the challenged government directives. Pursuant to the court's order, the plaintiffs submitted a proposed judgment, which the court reviewed and modified. On June 18, the plaintiffs submitted a revised proposed judgment reflecting the court's modifications for further review.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 Phase 2 unreasonable delay claims, arguing lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. They also requested an expedited response deadline of June 26.\n\nOn June 23, 2025, the court adopted the plaintiffs\u2019 revised proposed judgment, holding that the challenged directives and resulting grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious, and therefore void, unlawful, and without legal effect. The court further ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiffs on Count Three of their amended complaint.\n\nThe defendants appealed the order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that same day and subsequently filed a motion in the district court to stay the judgment pending appeal. The court denied the motion, finding that a stay would result in irreparable harm to the plaintiffs.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, in the First Circuit, defendant-appellants filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, along with a request for an immediate administrative stay. The First Circuit denied the request for immediate relief the following day, stating that it would rule on the broader motion for a stay pending appeal as soon as practicable.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the First Circuit denied to stay the district court\u2019s judgment pending appeal. The court concluded the defendants were unlikely to succeed on the merits: the case involved declaratory and equitable relief under the APA, not a contract dispute for money damages, and agency discretion arguments were forfeited or limited by statutory requirements. The court upheld the district court\u2019s finding that NIH\u2019s grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious, noting undefined prohibited research categories, lack of scientific justification, and interference from a non-NIH group, as well as unaddressed reliance interests of grantees. While the defendants might suffer some financial harm, the court held this was outweighed by irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, including lost research, euthanized animal subjects, and delayed clinical trials. Granting a stay would substantially injure plaintiffs, and the public interest favored enforcing federal law and preserving critical, life-saving research.\n\nOn July 24, 2025, the defendants filed a Supreme Court stay application, arguing that the district court likely lacked jurisdiction and citing Department of Education v. California as precedent. They contended that the Court of Federal Claims, not a district court, was the proper forum for suits seeking government payments and that the district court\u2019s decision amounted to \u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d of the administration\u2019s policy priorities.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court partially granted and partially denied the stay application. The court stayed the district court\u2019s judgments vacating the government\u2019s termination of research grants, reasoning that the court likely lacked jurisdiction over claims based on a contractual \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d which belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the government would face irreparable harm if funds were disbursed. However, the court denied the stay for judgments vacating the NIH guidance documents, finding that the government had failed to show irreparable harm from their vacatur. The decision was closely divided: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh favored granting the stay in full; the Chief Justice and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson favored denying it in full; and Justice Barrett concurred in the partial grant and partial denial.\n\nThe case remains ongoing, with Phase 2 claims regarding unreasonable delays and pending appeals still unresolved.",

    "target": "The lawsuit arose from a series of government directives beginning in February 2025 aimed at terminating NIH-funded research on topics and populations the administration disfavored, including \u201cgender identity,\u201d \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u201d (DEI), \u201cvaccine hesitancy,\u201d and studies involving certain foreign entities. According to the complaint, these directives followed President Trump\u2019s January 2025 executive orders seeking to end equity-related programs and grants. The plaintiffs alleged that, in response, NIH issued guidance instructing staff to identify and terminate grants in these categories, abruptly ending ongoing projects\u2014many years in progress with substantial financial and time investments\u2014and refusing to consider certain pending applications, including those aimed at diversifying researcher backgrounds.\n\nSince January 2025, NIH has also canceled grant application meetings, indefinitely postponed future ones, and withheld final decisions on applications already approved through the standard review process. The agency sent hundreds of letters to grant recipients at public research institutions in the plaintiff states, terminating previously issued grants because they \u201cno longer effectuate agency priorities.\u201d The plaintiffs argued these actions lacked scientific justification and disregarded established NIH protocols, which normally require non-compliance or cause to justify termination.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, sixteen states filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its Director, and numerous federal agencies responsible for conducting and supporting biomedical research. Judge Brian E. Murphy was initially assigned to the case, but recused himself on May 1, 2025. The case was later reassigned to Judge William G. Young.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Separation of Powers doctrine, and the Spending Clause. They alleged that the defendants\u2019 actions violated the APA by unlawfully withholding or unreasonably delaying agency action, taking action contrary to regulation or statute, and engaging in arbitrary and capricious conduct.\n\nThe plaintiffs initially filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), but on April 8, 2025, filed an assented-to motion withdrawing their TRO request and asking the court to approve a briefing schedule for a motion for a Preliminary Injunction (PI). On April 14, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, along with a motion for a PI. The amended complaint expanded the original claims by directly linking NIH's grant disruptions to executive orders targeting DEI and gender identity. It reframed the case as a challenge to unlawful \"blacklisting directives\" and sought broader relief, including the invalidation of those directives.\n\nA hearing on subject matter jurisdiction was held on May 8. On May 12, the court issued an order affirming its subject matter jurisdiction. On May 29, a joint statement of counsel was filed, outlining an agreed-upon plan for resolving the grant termination issues (Phase 1) and identifying a dispute regarding how to handle the unreasonable delay claims (Phase 2). Each party submitted their respective proposals.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, the court held a Phase 1 bench trial and ruled in favor of the plaintiffs by vacating the challenged government directives. Pursuant to the court's order, the plaintiffs submitted a proposed judgment, which the court reviewed and modified. On June 18, the plaintiffs submitted a revised proposed judgment reflecting the court's modifications for further review.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 Phase 2 unreasonable delay claims, arguing lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. They also requested an expedited response deadline of June 26.\n\nOn June 23, 2025, the court adopted the plaintiffs\u2019 revised proposed judgment, holding that the challenged directives and resulting grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious, and therefore void, unlawful, and without legal effect. The court further ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiffs on Count Three of their amended complaint.\n\nThe defendants appealed the order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that same day and subsequently filed a motion in the district court to stay the judgment pending appeal. The court denied the motion, finding that a stay would result in irreparable harm to the plaintiffs.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, in the First Circuit, defendant-appellants filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, along with a request for an immediate administrative stay. The First Circuit denied the request for immediate relief the following day, stating that it would rule on the broader motion for a stay pending appeal as soon as practicable.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the First Circuit denied to stay the district court\u2019s judgment pending appeal. The court concluded the defendants were unlikely to succeed on the merits: the case involved declaratory and equitable relief under the APA, not a contract dispute for money damages, and agency discretion arguments were forfeited or limited by statutory requirements. The court upheld the district court\u2019s finding that NIH\u2019s grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious, noting undefined prohibited research categories, lack of scientific justification, and interference from a non-NIH group, as well as unaddressed reliance interests of grantees. While the defendants might suffer some financial harm, the court held this was outweighed by irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, including lost research, euthanized animal subjects, and delayed clinical trials. Granting a stay would substantially injure plaintiffs, and the public interest favored enforcing federal law and preserving critical, life-saving research.\n\nOn July 24, 2025, the defendants filed a Supreme Court stay application, arguing that the district court likely lacked jurisdiction and citing Department of Education v. California as precedent. They contended that the Court of Federal Claims, not a district court, was the proper forum for suits seeking government payments and that the district court\u2019s decision amounted to \u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d of the administration\u2019s policy priorities.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court partially granted and partially denied the stay application. The court stayed the district court\u2019s judgments vacating the government\u2019s termination of research grants, reasoning that the court likely lacked jurisdiction over claims based on a contractual \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d which belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the government would face irreparable harm if funds were disbursed. However, the court denied the stay for judgments vacating the NIH guidance documents, finding that the government had failed to show irreparable harm from their vacatur. The decision was closely divided: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh favored granting the stay in full; the Chief Justice and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson favored denying it in full; and Justice Barrett concurred in the partial grant and partial denial.\n\nThe case remains ongoing, with Phase 2 claims regarding unreasonable delays and pending appeals still unresolved.",

Granting a stay would substantially injure plaintiffs, and the public interest favored enforcing federal law and preserving critical, life-saving research.\n\nOn July 24, 2025, the defendants filed a Supreme Court stay application, arguing that the district court likely lacked jurisdiction and citing Department of Education v. California as precedent. They contended that the Court of Federal Claims, not a district court, was the proper forum for suits seeking government payments and that the district court\u2019s decision amounted to \u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d of the administration\u2019s policy priorities.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court partially granted and partially denied the stay application. The court stayed the district court\u2019s judgments vacating the government\u2019s termination of research grants, reasoning that the court likely lacked jurisdiction over claims based on a contractual \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d which belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the government would face irreparable harm if funds were disbursed. However, the court denied the stay for judgments vacating the NIH guidance documents, finding that the government had failed to show irreparable harm from their vacatur. The decision was closely divided: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh favored granting the stay in full; the Chief Justice and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson favored denying it in full; and Justice Barrett concurred in the partial grant and partial denial.\n\nThe case remains ongoing, with Phase 2 claims regarding unreasonable delays and pending appeals still unresolved.",

    "target": "The lawsuit arose from a series of government directives beginning in February 2025 aimed at terminating NIH-funded research on topics and populations the administration disfavored, including \u201cgender identity,\u201d \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u201d (DEI), \u201cvaccine hesitancy,\u201d and studies involving certain foreign entities. According to the complaint, these directives followed President Trump\u2019s January 2025 executive orders seeking to end equity-related programs and grants. The plaintiffs alleged that, in response, NIH issued guidance instructing staff to identify and terminate grants in these categories, abruptly ending ongoing projects\u2014many years in progress with substantial financial and time investments\u2014and refusing to consider certain pending applications, including those aimed at diversifying researcher backgrounds.\n\nSince January 2025, NIH has also canceled grant application meetings, indefinitely postponed future ones, and withheld final decisions on applications already approved through the standard review process. The agency sent hundreds of letters to grant recipients at public research institutions in the plaintiff states, terminating previously issued grants because they \u201cno longer effectuate agency priorities.\u201d The plaintiffs argued these actions lacked scientific justification and disregarded established NIH protocols, which normally require non-compliance or cause to justify termination.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, sixteen states filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its Director, and numerous federal agencies responsible for conducting and supporting biomedical research. Judge Brian E. Murphy was initially assigned to the case, but recused himself on May 1, 2025. The case was later reassigned to Judge William G. Young.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Separation of Powers doctrine, and the Spending Clause. They alleged that the defendants\u2019 actions violated the APA by unlawfully withholding or unreasonably delaying agency action, taking action contrary to regulation or statute, and engaging in arbitrary and capricious conduct.\n\nThe plaintiffs initially filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), but on April 8, 2025, filed an assented-to motion withdrawing their TRO request and asking the court to approve a briefing schedule for a motion for a Preliminary Injunction (PI). On April 14, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, along with a motion for a PI. The amended complaint expanded the original claims by directly linking NIH's grant disruptions to executive orders targeting DEI and gender identity. It reframed the case as a challenge to unlawful \"blacklisting directives\" and sought broader relief, including the invalidation of those directives.\n\nA hearing on subject matter jurisdiction was held on May 8. On May 12, the court issued an order affirming its subject matter jurisdiction. On May 29, a joint statement of counsel was filed, outlining an agreed-upon plan for resolving the grant termination issues (Phase 1) and identifying a dispute regarding how to handle the unreasonable delay claims (Phase 2). Each party submitted their respective proposals.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, the court held a Phase 1 bench trial and ruled in favor of the plaintiffs by vacating the challenged government directives. Pursuant to the court's order, the plaintiffs submitted a proposed judgment, which the court reviewed and modified. On June 18, the plaintiffs submitted a revised proposed judgment reflecting the court's modifications for further review.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 Phase 2 unreasonable delay claims, arguing lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. They also requested an expedited response deadline of June 26.\n\nOn June 23, 2025, the court adopted the plaintiffs\u2019 revised proposed judgment, holding that the challenged directives and resulting grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious, and therefore void, unlawful, and without legal effect. The court further ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiffs on Count Three of their amended complaint.\n\nThe defendants appealed the order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that same day and subsequently filed a motion in the district court to stay the judgment pending appeal. The court denied the motion, finding that a stay would result in irreparable harm to the plaintiffs.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, in the First Circuit, defendant-appellants filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, along with a request for an immediate administrative stay. The First Circuit denied the request for immediate relief the following day, stating that it would rule on the broader motion for a stay pending appeal as soon as practicable.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the First Circuit denied to stay the district court\u2019s judgment pending appeal. The court concluded the defendants were unlikely to succeed on the merits: the case involved declaratory and equitable relief under the APA, not a contract dispute for money damages, and agency discretion arguments were forfeited or limited by statutory requirements. The court upheld the district court\u2019s finding that NIH\u2019s grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious, noting undefined prohibited research categories, lack of scientific justification, and interference from a non-NIH group, as well as unaddressed reliance interests of grantees.

    "target": "The lawsuit arose from a series of government directives beginning in February 2025 aimed at terminating NIH-funded research on topics and populations the administration disfavored, including \u201cgender identity,\u201d \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u201d (DEI), \u201cvaccine hesitancy,\u201d and studies involving certain foreign entities. According to the complaint, these directives followed President Trump\u2019s January 2025 executive orders seeking to end equity-related programs and grants. The plaintiffs alleged that, in response, NIH issued guidance instructing staff to identify and terminate grants in these categories, abruptly ending ongoing projects\u2014many years in progress with substantial financial and time investments\u2014and refusing to consider certain pending applications, including those aimed at diversifying researcher backgrounds.\n\nSince January 2025, NIH has also canceled grant application meetings, indefinitely postponed future ones, and withheld final decisions on applications already approved through the standard review process. The agency sent hundreds of letters to grant recipients at public research institutions in the plaintiff states, terminating previously issued grants because they \u201cno longer effectuate agency priorities.\u201d The plaintiffs argued these actions lacked scientific justification and disregarded established NIH protocols, which normally require non-compliance or cause to justify termination.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, sixteen states filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its Director, and numerous federal agencies responsible for conducting and supporting biomedical research. Judge Brian E. Murphy was initially assigned to the case, but recused himself on May 1, 2025. The case was later reassigned to Judge William G. Young.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Separation of Powers doctrine, and the Spending Clause. They alleged that the defendants\u2019 actions violated the APA by unlawfully withholding or unreasonably delaying agency action, taking action contrary to regulation or statute, and engaging in arbitrary and capricious conduct.\n\nThe plaintiffs initially filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), but on April 8, 2025, filed an assented-to motion withdrawing their TRO request and asking the court to approve a briefing schedule for a motion for a Preliminary Injunction (PI). On April 14, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, along with a motion for a PI. The amended complaint expanded the original claims by directly linking NIH's grant disruptions to executive orders targeting DEI and gender identity. It reframed the case as a challenge to unlawful \"blacklisting directives\" and sought broader relief, including the invalidation of those directives.\n\nA hearing on subject matter jurisdiction was held on May 8. On May 12, the court issued an order affirming its subject matter jurisdiction. On May 29, a joint statement of counsel was filed, outlining an agreed-upon plan for resolving the grant termination issues (Phase 1) and identifying a dispute regarding how to handle the unreasonable delay claims (Phase 2). Each party submitted their respective proposals.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, the court held a Phase 1 bench trial and ruled in favor of the plaintiffs by vacating the challenged government directives. Pursuant to the court's order, the plaintiffs submitted a proposed judgment, which the court reviewed and modified. On June 18, the plaintiffs submitted a revised proposed judgment reflecting the court's modifications for further review.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 Phase 2 unreasonable delay claims, arguing lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. They also requested an expedited response deadline of June 26.\n\nOn June 23, 2025, the court adopted the plaintiffs\u2019 revised proposed judgment, holding that the challenged directives and resulting grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious, and therefore void, unlawful, and without legal effect. The court further ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiffs on Count Three of their amended complaint.\n\nThe defendants appealed the order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that same day and subsequently filed a motion in the district court to stay the judgment pending appeal. The court denied the motion, finding that a stay would result in irreparable harm to the plaintiffs.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, in the First Circuit, defendant-appellants filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, along with a request for an immediate administrative stay. The First Circuit denied the request for immediate relief the following day, stating that it would rule on the broader motion for a stay pending appeal as soon as practicable.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the First Circuit denied to stay the district court\u2019s judgment pending appeal. The court concluded the defendants were unlikely to succeed on the merits: the case involved declaratory and equitable relief under the APA, not a contract dispute for money damages, and agency discretion arguments were forfeited or limited by statutory requirements. The court upheld the district court\u2019s finding that NIH\u2019s grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious, noting undefined prohibited research categories, lack of scientific justification, and interference from a non-NIH group, as well as unaddressed reliance interests of grantees. While the defendants might suffer some financial harm, the court held this was outweighed by irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, including lost research, euthanized animal subjects, and delayed clinical trials. Granting a stay would substantially injure plaintiffs, and the public interest favored enforcing federal law and preserving critical, life-saving research.\n\nOn July 24, 2025, the defendants filed a Supreme Court stay application, arguing that the district court likely lacked jurisdiction and citing Department of Education v. California as precedent. They contended that the Court of Federal Claims, not a district court, was the proper forum for suits seeking government payments and that the district court\u2019s decision amounted to \u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d of the administration\u2019s policy priorities.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court partially granted and partially denied the stay application. The court stayed the district court\u2019s judgments vacating the government\u2019s termination of research grants, reasoning that the court likely lacked jurisdiction over claims based on a contractual \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d which belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the government would face irreparable harm if funds were disbursed. However, the court denied the stay for judgments vacating the NIH guidance documents, finding that the government had failed to show irreparable harm from their vacatur. The decision was closely divided: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh favored granting the stay in full; the Chief Justice and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson favored denying it in full; and Justice Barrett concurred in the partial grant and partial denial.\n\nThe case remains ongoing, with Phase 2 claims regarding unreasonable delays and pending appeals still unresolved.",

On May 29, a joint statement of counsel was filed, outlining an agreed-upon plan for resolving the grant termination issues (Phase 1) and identifying a dispute regarding how to handle the unreasonable delay claims (Phase 2). Each party submitted their respective proposals.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, the court held a Phase 1 bench trial and ruled in favor of the plaintiffs by vacating the challenged government directives. Pursuant to the court's order, the plaintiffs submitted a proposed judgment, which the court reviewed and modified. On June 18, the plaintiffs submitted a revised proposed judgment reflecting the court's modifications for further review.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 Phase 2 unreasonable delay claims, arguing lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. They also requested an expedited response deadline of June 26.\n\nOn June 23, 2025, the court adopted the plaintiffs\u2019 revised proposed judgment, holding that the challenged directives and resulting grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious, and therefore void, unlawful, and without legal effect. The court further ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiffs on Count Three of their amended complaint.\n\nThe defendants appealed the order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that same day and subsequently filed a motion in the district court to stay the judgment pending appeal. The court denied the motion, finding that a stay would result in irreparable harm to the plaintiffs.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, in the First Circuit, defendant-appellants filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, along with a request for an immediate administrative stay. The First Circuit denied the request for immediate relief the following day, stating that it would rule on the broader motion for a stay pending appeal as soon as practicable.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the First Circuit denied to stay the district court\u2019s judgment pending appeal. The court concluded the defendants were unlikely to succeed on the merits: the case involved declaratory and equitable relief under the APA, not a contract dispute for money damages, and agency discretion arguments were forfeited or limited by statutory requirements. The court upheld the district court\u2019s finding that NIH\u2019s grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious, noting undefined prohibited research categories, lack of scientific justification, and interference from a non-NIH group, as well as unaddressed reliance interests of grantees. While the defendants might suffer some financial harm, the court held this was outweighed by irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, including lost research, euthanized animal subjects, and delayed clinical trials. Granting a stay would substantially injure plaintiffs, and the public interest favored enforcing federal law and preserving critical, life-saving research.\n\nOn July 24, 2025, the defendants filed a Supreme Court stay application, arguing that the district court likely lacked jurisdiction and citing Department of Education v. California as precedent. They contended that the Court of Federal Claims, not a district court, was the proper forum for suits seeking government payments and that the district court\u2019s decision amounted to \u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d of the administration\u2019s policy priorities.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court partially granted and partially denied the stay application. The court stayed the district court\u2019s judgments vacating the government\u2019s termination of research grants, reasoning that the court likely lacked jurisdiction over claims based on a contractual \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d which belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the government would face irreparable harm if funds were disbursed. However, the court denied the stay for judgments vacating the NIH guidance documents, finding that the government had failed to show irreparable harm from their vacatur. The decision was closely divided: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh favored granting the stay in full; the Chief Justice and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson favored denying it in full; and Justice Barrett concurred in the partial grant and partial denial.\n\nThe case remains ongoing, with Phase 2 claims regarding unreasonable delays and pending appeals still unresolved.",
