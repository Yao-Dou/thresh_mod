    "target": "On March 5, 2019, plaintiffs\u2014immigrant youth under the age of 21 who applied for Special Immigrant Juvenile status (\u201cSIJ\u201d)\u2014filed a class action lawsuit in the Western District of Washington on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated to challenge the Trump Administration\u2019s policy of refusing to adjudicate their SIJ petitions in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). The complaint was filed on behalf of the following proposed class:\n\n\u201cAll individuals who have been issued predicate SIJS orders by Washington state courts after turning eighteen years old but prior to turning twenty-one years old, and have submitted or will submit SIJS petitions to USCIS prior to turning twenty-one years old.\u201d\n\nFiled against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d), and their respective directors, the complaint alleged that USCIS began denying SIJ applications unless petitioners could show that a state court had the power to return the youth to the custody of their parents. This resulted in USCIS denying petitions to applicants after turning 18 but before the age of 21. \u00a0USCIS also delayed the adjudications of numerous applications. These actions, the complaint claimed, were in violation of the INA\u2019s text. Plaintiffs, thus, sought declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin this unlawful agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). Plaintiffs also alleged, under the APA, that the agency action was arbitrary and capricious; that the new policy was promulgated without notice-and-comment rulemaking; and that action could not be unreasonably delayed beyond the 180 day statutory deadline. Due to the defendant\u2019s duty to adjudicate applications without unreasonable delay, the plaintiffs further sought a writ of mandamus to compel a federal official or agency to adjudicate SIJ applications. The plaintiffs were represented by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. The case was assigned to Judge Robert S. Lasnik.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class and a motion for a preliminary injunction that same day. The State of Washington filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs on March 25, 2019. On July 17, 2019, the court certified the class. 2019 WL 3219418. The court also granted the motion for preliminary injunction. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate outstanding SIJ petitions and to readjudicate cases that were denied on grounds that state courts did not have jurisdiction to \u201creunify\u201d an immigrant with their parents. 387 F.Supp.3d 1208.\n\nFollowing the court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the judgment on August 7, 2019. Subsequently on August 22, the defendants also requested that certain portions of the preliminary injunction be stayed. However, on August 23, the court denied the motion for reconsideration, citing that the defendants offered no new facts or legal authority that would justify reconsideration. 2019 WL 3996850.\n\nGiven the court\u2019s unwillingness to reconsider the order, the defendants then appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit (No. 19-35884) on October 22, 2019. However, on February 28, 2020, the defendants filed an unopposed motion to dismiss the appeal, which was then granted on March 4, 2020.\n\nBack in district court, the plaintiffs then filed a motion for summary judgment on May 1, 2020, which included a request for permanent injunctive relief. The court granted summary judgment on October 5, finding that the reunification requirement was arbitrary and capricious and that the delays in adjudication were plainly unlawful as Congress unambiguously intended the adjudication to be expeditious, providing a clear and mandatory deadline of 180 days. The court also entered a permanent injunction, specifically with regard to adjudication timelines. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application was filed by the petitioner. The injunction, though, permitted SIJ petitioners to \u201ctoll\u201d the deadline to respond to a request for evidence. 492 F.Supp.3d 1169.\n\nA month later, the defendants appealed this order to the Ninth Circuit as well (20-36052). Following motions to extend the time to file their briefings, the defendants filed their opening brief on July 20, 2021, to which the plaintiffs responded on September 20. Oral arguments were then scheduled for March 9, 2022. Prior to this, though, the defendants submitted a letter to the court to notify that USCIS anticipated a final rule implicating Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) petitions would be issued in the near future, potentially before oral arguments. Following oral arguments on March 9, the court requested the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez,142 S. Ct. 2057 (2022), which held that injunctive relief was precluded for certain provisions of the INA.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit entered judgment on November 3, 2022, affirming in part and vacating in part the district court\u2019s opinion. The Ninth Circuit determined that the district court had jurisdiction to enter a permanent injunction, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Aleman Gonzalez, noting that the provision of the INA implicated in this case was not one that precluded injunctive relief. However, the court did find that the district court abused its discretion when permitting each and every SIJ petitioner to \u201ctoll\u201d indefinitely Congress\u2019s timeline for adjudicating SIJ petitions. According to the Ninth Circuit panel, the tolling provisions of the injunction were not narrowly tailored to remedy the harm and did not contemplate USCIS\u2019s relevant regulations. As such, this portion of the injunction was vacated. 52 F.4th 821.\n\nFollowing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s official mandate on February 10, 2023, the parties were ordered to submit a joint status report prior to July, proposing amendments to the permanent injunction consistent with the Ninth Circuit's order. Following the parties\u2019 submission of the joint status report, a hearing was held on September 21, 2023.\n\nAn amended permanent injunction was then entered by the district court on September 22, and stated as follows:\n\n\u201cDefendants must adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application is filed by the petitioner\u2026 This timeline is inclusive of any requests for additional evidence or notices of intent to deny that USCIS may issue to a petitioner. USCIS must provide SIJ petitioners with sufficient time prior to the expiration of the 180 days to respond to the request/notice in an effort to complete final adjudication of the SIJ petition in a timely manner. USCIS may not use the issuance of a request for information or notice of intent to deny for the sole purpose of avoiding the statutory deadline for adjudication of an SIJ petition.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs then filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs on December 14, 2023. Briefing deadlines on the matter were extended on multiple occasions as settlement negotiations on the matter continued. On May 22, 2024, the court preliminarily approved the settlement agreement and scheduled a final approval hearing on the matter for September. On September 5, 2024, the final settlement agreement was approved, whereby the defendants agreed to pay the plaintiffs $400,000.\n\nThe case is now considered closed.",

    "target": "On March 5, 2019, plaintiffs\u2014immigrant youth under the age of 21 who applied for Special Immigrant Juvenile status (\u201cSIJ\u201d)\u2014filed a class action lawsuit in the Western District of Washington on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated to challenge the Trump Administration\u2019s policy of refusing to adjudicate their SIJ petitions in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). The complaint was filed on behalf of the following proposed class:\n\n\u201cAll individuals who have been issued predicate SIJS orders by Washington state courts after turning eighteen years old but prior to turning twenty-one years old, and have submitted or will submit SIJS petitions to USCIS prior to turning twenty-one years old.\u201d\n\nFiled against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d), and their respective directors, the complaint alleged that USCIS began denying SIJ applications unless petitioners could show that a state court had the power to return the youth to the custody of their parents. This resulted in USCIS denying petitions to applicants after turning 18 but before the age of 21. \u00a0USCIS also delayed the adjudications of numerous applications. These actions, the complaint claimed, were in violation of the INA\u2019s text. Plaintiffs, thus, sought declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin this unlawful agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). Plaintiffs also alleged, under the APA, that the agency action was arbitrary and capricious; that the new policy was promulgated without notice-and-comment rulemaking; and that action could not be unreasonably delayed beyond the 180 day statutory deadline. Due to the defendant\u2019s duty to adjudicate applications without unreasonable delay, the plaintiffs further sought a writ of mandamus to compel a federal official or agency to adjudicate SIJ applications. The plaintiffs were represented by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. The case was assigned to Judge Robert S. Lasnik.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class and a motion for a preliminary injunction that same day. The State of Washington filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs on March 25, 2019. On July 17, 2019, the court certified the class. 2019 WL 3219418. The court also granted the motion for preliminary injunction. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate outstanding SIJ petitions and to readjudicate cases that were denied on grounds that state courts did not have jurisdiction to \u201creunify\u201d an immigrant with their parents. 387 F.Supp.3d 1208.\n\nFollowing the court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the judgment on August 7, 2019. Subsequently on August 22, the defendants also requested that certain portions of the preliminary injunction be stayed. However, on August 23, the court denied the motion for reconsideration, citing that the defendants offered no new facts or legal authority that would justify reconsideration. 2019 WL 3996850.\n\nGiven the court\u2019s unwillingness to reconsider the order, the defendants then appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit (No. 19-35884) on October 22, 2019. However, on February 28, 2020, the defendants filed an unopposed motion to dismiss the appeal, which was then granted on March 4, 2020.\n\nBack in district court, the plaintiffs then filed a motion for summary judgment on May 1, 2020, which included a request for permanent injunctive relief. The court granted summary judgment on October 5, finding that the reunification requirement was arbitrary and capricious and that the delays in adjudication were plainly unlawful as Congress unambiguously intended the adjudication to be expeditious, providing a clear and mandatory deadline of 180 days. The court also entered a permanent injunction, specifically with regard to adjudication timelines. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application was filed by the petitioner. The injunction, though, permitted SIJ petitioners to \u201ctoll\u201d the deadline to respond to a request for evidence. 492 F.Supp.3d 1169.\n\nA month later, the defendants appealed this order to the Ninth Circuit as well (20-36052). Following motions to extend the time to file their briefings, the defendants filed their opening brief on July 20, 2021, to which the plaintiffs responded on September 20. Oral arguments were then scheduled for March 9, 2022. Prior to this, though, the defendants submitted a letter to the court to notify that USCIS anticipated a final rule implicating Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) petitions would be issued in the near future, potentially before oral arguments. Following oral arguments on March 9, the court requested the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez,142 S. Ct. 2057 (2022), which held that injunctive relief was precluded for certain provisions of the INA.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit entered judgment on November 3, 2022, affirming in part and vacating in part the district court\u2019s opinion. The Ninth Circuit determined that the district court had jurisdiction to enter a permanent injunction, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Aleman Gonzalez, noting that the provision of the INA implicated in this case was not one that precluded injunctive relief. However, the court did find that the district court abused its discretion when permitting each and every SIJ petitioner to \u201ctoll\u201d indefinitely Congress\u2019s timeline for adjudicating SIJ petitions. According to the Ninth Circuit panel, the tolling provisions of the injunction were not narrowly tailored to remedy the harm and did not contemplate USCIS\u2019s relevant regulations. As such, this portion of the injunction was vacated. 52 F.4th 821.\n\nFollowing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s official mandate on February 10, 2023, the parties were ordered to submit a joint status report prior to July, proposing amendments to the permanent injunction consistent with the Ninth Circuit's order. Following the parties\u2019 submission of the joint status report, a hearing was held on September 21, 2023.\n\nAn amended permanent injunction was then entered by the district court on September 22, and stated as follows:\n\n\u201cDefendants must adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application is filed by the petitioner\u2026 This timeline is inclusive of any requests for additional evidence or notices of intent to deny that USCIS may issue to a petitioner. USCIS must provide SIJ petitioners with sufficient time prior to the expiration of the 180 days to respond to the request/notice in an effort to complete final adjudication of the SIJ petition in a timely manner. USCIS may not use the issuance of a request for information or notice of intent to deny for the sole purpose of avoiding the statutory deadline for adjudication of an SIJ petition.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs then filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs on December 14, 2023. Briefing deadlines on the matter were extended on multiple occasions as settlement negotiations on the matter continued. On May 22, 2024, the court preliminarily approved the settlement agreement and scheduled a final approval hearing on the matter for September. On September 5, 2024, the final settlement agreement was approved, whereby the defendants agreed to pay the plaintiffs $400,000.\n\nThe case is now considered closed.",

    "target": "On March 5, 2019, plaintiffs\u2014immigrant youth under the age of 21 who applied for Special Immigrant Juvenile status (\u201cSIJ\u201d)\u2014filed a class action lawsuit in the Western District of Washington on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated to challenge the Trump Administration\u2019s policy of refusing to adjudicate their SIJ petitions in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). The complaint was filed on behalf of the following proposed class:\n\n\u201cAll individuals who have been issued predicate SIJS orders by Washington state courts after turning eighteen years old but prior to turning twenty-one years old, and have submitted or will submit SIJS petitions to USCIS prior to turning twenty-one years old.\u201d\n\nFiled against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d), and their respective directors, the complaint alleged that USCIS began denying SIJ applications unless petitioners could show that a state court had the power to return the youth to the custody of their parents. This resulted in USCIS denying petitions to applicants after turning 18 but before the age of 21. \u00a0USCIS also delayed the adjudications of numerous applications. These actions, the complaint claimed, were in violation of the INA\u2019s text. Plaintiffs, thus, sought declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin this unlawful agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). Plaintiffs also alleged, under the APA, that the agency action was arbitrary and capricious; that the new policy was promulgated without notice-and-comment rulemaking; and that action could not be unreasonably delayed beyond the 180 day statutory deadline. Due to the defendant\u2019s duty to adjudicate applications without unreasonable delay, the plaintiffs further sought a writ of mandamus to compel a federal official or agency to adjudicate SIJ applications. The plaintiffs were represented by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. The case was assigned to Judge Robert S. Lasnik.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class and a motion for a preliminary injunction that same day. The State of Washington filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs on March 25, 2019. On July 17, 2019, the court certified the class. 2019 WL 3219418. The court also granted the motion for preliminary injunction. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate outstanding SIJ petitions and to readjudicate cases that were denied on grounds that state courts did not have jurisdiction to \u201creunify\u201d an immigrant with their parents. 387 F.Supp.3d 1208.\n\nFollowing the court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the judgment on August 7, 2019. Subsequently on August 22, the defendants also requested that certain portions of the preliminary injunction be stayed. However, on August 23, the court denied the motion for reconsideration, citing that the defendants offered no new facts or legal authority that would justify reconsideration. 2019 WL 3996850.\n\nGiven the court\u2019s unwillingness to reconsider the order, the defendants then appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit (No. 19-35884) on October 22, 2019. However, on February 28, 2020, the defendants filed an unopposed motion to dismiss the appeal, which was then granted on March 4, 2020.\n\nBack in district court, the plaintiffs then filed a motion for summary judgment on May 1, 2020, which included a request for permanent injunctive relief. The court granted summary judgment on October 5, finding that the reunification requirement was arbitrary and capricious and that the delays in adjudication were plainly unlawful as Congress unambiguously intended the adjudication to be expeditious, providing a clear and mandatory deadline of 180 days. The court also entered a permanent injunction, specifically with regard to adjudication timelines. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application was filed by the petitioner. The injunction, though, permitted SIJ petitioners to \u201ctoll\u201d the deadline to respond to a request for evidence. 492 F.Supp.3d 1169.\n\nA month later, the defendants appealed this order to the Ninth Circuit as well (20-36052). Following motions to extend the time to file their briefings, the defendants filed their opening brief on July 20, 2021, to which the plaintiffs responded on September 20. Oral arguments were then scheduled for March 9, 2022. Prior to this, though, the defendants submitted a letter to the court to notify that USCIS anticipated a final rule implicating Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) petitions would be issued in the near future, potentially before oral arguments. Following oral arguments on March 9, the court requested the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez,142 S. Ct. 2057 (2022), which held that injunctive relief was precluded for certain provisions of the INA.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit entered judgment on November 3, 2022, affirming in part and vacating in part the district court\u2019s opinion. The Ninth Circuit determined that the district court had jurisdiction to enter a permanent injunction, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Aleman Gonzalez, noting that the provision of the INA implicated in this case was not one that precluded injunctive relief. However, the court did find that the district court abused its discretion when permitting each and every SIJ petitioner to \u201ctoll\u201d indefinitely Congress\u2019s timeline for adjudicating SIJ petitions. According to the Ninth Circuit panel, the tolling provisions of the injunction were not narrowly tailored to remedy the harm and did not contemplate USCIS\u2019s relevant regulations. As such, this portion of the injunction was vacated. 52 F.4th 821.\n\nFollowing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s official mandate on February 10, 2023, the parties were ordered to submit a joint status report prior to July, proposing amendments to the permanent injunction consistent with the Ninth Circuit's order. Following the parties\u2019 submission of the joint status report, a hearing was held on September 21, 2023.\n\nAn amended permanent injunction was then entered by the district court on September 22, and stated as follows:\n\n\u201cDefendants must adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application is filed by the petitioner\u2026 This timeline is inclusive of any requests for additional evidence or notices of intent to deny that USCIS may issue to a petitioner. USCIS must provide SIJ petitioners with sufficient time prior to the expiration of the 180 days to respond to the request/notice in an effort to complete final adjudication of the SIJ petition in a timely manner. USCIS may not use the issuance of a request for information or notice of intent to deny for the sole purpose of avoiding the statutory deadline for adjudication of an SIJ petition.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs then filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs on December 14, 2023.

    "target": "On March 5, 2019, plaintiffs\u2014immigrant youth under the age of 21 who applied for Special Immigrant Juvenile status (\u201cSIJ\u201d)\u2014filed a class action lawsuit in the Western District of Washington on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated to challenge the Trump Administration\u2019s policy of refusing to adjudicate their SIJ petitions in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). The complaint was filed on behalf of the following proposed class:\n\n\u201cAll individuals who have been issued predicate SIJS orders by Washington state courts after turning eighteen years old but prior to turning twenty-one years old, and have submitted or will submit SIJS petitions to USCIS prior to turning twenty-one years old.\u201d\n\nFiled against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d), and their respective directors, the complaint alleged that USCIS began denying SIJ applications unless petitioners could show that a state court had the power to return the youth to the custody of their parents. This resulted in USCIS denying petitions to applicants after turning 18 but before the age of 21. \u00a0USCIS also delayed the adjudications of numerous applications. These actions, the complaint claimed, were in violation of the INA\u2019s text. Plaintiffs, thus, sought declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin this unlawful agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). Plaintiffs also alleged, under the APA, that the agency action was arbitrary and capricious; that the new policy was promulgated without notice-and-comment rulemaking; and that action could not be unreasonably delayed beyond the 180 day statutory deadline. Due to the defendant\u2019s duty to adjudicate applications without unreasonable delay, the plaintiffs further sought a writ of mandamus to compel a federal official or agency to adjudicate SIJ applications. The plaintiffs were represented by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. The case was assigned to Judge Robert S. Lasnik.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class and a motion for a preliminary injunction that same day. The State of Washington filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs on March 25, 2019. On July 17, 2019, the court certified the class. 2019 WL 3219418. The court also granted the motion for preliminary injunction. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate outstanding SIJ petitions and to readjudicate cases that were denied on grounds that state courts did not have jurisdiction to \u201creunify\u201d an immigrant with their parents. 387 F.Supp.3d 1208.\n\nFollowing the court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the judgment on August 7, 2019. Subsequently on August 22, the defendants also requested that certain portions of the preliminary injunction be stayed. However, on August 23, the court denied the motion for reconsideration, citing that the defendants offered no new facts or legal authority that would justify reconsideration. 2019 WL 3996850.\n\nGiven the court\u2019s unwillingness to reconsider the order, the defendants then appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit (No. 19-35884) on October 22, 2019. However, on February 28, 2020, the defendants filed an unopposed motion to dismiss the appeal, which was then granted on March 4, 2020.\n\nBack in district court, the plaintiffs then filed a motion for summary judgment on May 1, 2020, which included a request for permanent injunctive relief. The court granted summary judgment on October 5, finding that the reunification requirement was arbitrary and capricious and that the delays in adjudication were plainly unlawful as Congress unambiguously intended the adjudication to be expeditious, providing a clear and mandatory deadline of 180 days. The court also entered a permanent injunction, specifically with regard to adjudication timelines. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application was filed by the petitioner. The injunction, though, permitted SIJ petitioners to \u201ctoll\u201d the deadline to respond to a request for evidence. 492 F.Supp.3d 1169.\n\nA month later, the defendants appealed this order to the Ninth Circuit as well (20-36052). Following motions to extend the time to file their briefings, the defendants filed their opening brief on July 20, 2021, to which the plaintiffs responded on September 20. Oral arguments were then scheduled for March 9, 2022. Prior to this, though, the defendants submitted a letter to the court to notify that USCIS anticipated a final rule implicating Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) petitions would be issued in the near future, potentially before oral arguments.

The Ninth Circuit determined that the district court had jurisdiction to enter a permanent injunction, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Aleman Gonzalez, noting that the provision of the INA implicated in this case was not one that precluded injunctive relief.

    "target": "On March 5, 2019, plaintiffs\u2014immigrant youth under the age of 21 who applied for Special Immigrant Juvenile status (\u201cSIJ\u201d)\u2014filed a class action lawsuit in the Western District of Washington on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated to challenge the Trump Administration\u2019s policy of refusing to adjudicate their SIJ petitions in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). The complaint was filed on behalf of the following proposed class:\n\n\u201cAll individuals who have been issued predicate SIJS orders by Washington state courts after turning eighteen years old but prior to turning twenty-one years old, and have submitted or will submit SIJS petitions to USCIS prior to turning twenty-one years old.\u201d\n\nFiled against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d), and their respective directors, the complaint alleged that USCIS began denying SIJ applications unless petitioners could show that a state court had the power to return the youth to the custody of their parents. This resulted in USCIS denying petitions to applicants after turning 18 but before the age of 21. \u00a0USCIS also delayed the adjudications of numerous applications. These actions, the complaint claimed, were in violation of the INA\u2019s text. Plaintiffs, thus, sought declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin this unlawful agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). Plaintiffs also alleged, under the APA, that the agency action was arbitrary and capricious; that the new policy was promulgated without notice-and-comment rulemaking; and that action could not be unreasonably delayed beyond the 180 day statutory deadline. Due to the defendant\u2019s duty to adjudicate applications without unreasonable delay, the plaintiffs further sought a writ of mandamus to compel a federal official or agency to adjudicate SIJ applications. The plaintiffs were represented by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. The case was assigned to Judge Robert S. Lasnik.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class and a motion for a preliminary injunction that same day. The State of Washington filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs on March 25, 2019. On July 17, 2019, the court certified the class. 2019 WL 3219418. The court also granted the motion for preliminary injunction. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate outstanding SIJ petitions and to readjudicate cases that were denied on grounds that state courts did not have jurisdiction to \u201creunify\u201d an immigrant with their parents. 387 F.Supp.3d 1208.\n\nFollowing the court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the judgment on August 7, 2019. Subsequently on August 22, the defendants also requested that certain portions of the preliminary injunction be stayed. However, on August 23, the court denied the motion for reconsideration, citing that the defendants offered no new facts or legal authority that would justify reconsideration. 2019 WL 3996850.\n\nGiven the court\u2019s unwillingness to reconsider the order, the defendants then appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit (No. 19-35884) on October 22, 2019. However, on February 28, 2020, the defendants filed an unopposed motion to dismiss the appeal, which was then granted on March 4, 2020.\n\nBack in district court, the plaintiffs then filed a motion for summary judgment on May 1, 2020, which included a request for permanent injunctive relief. The court granted summary judgment on October 5, finding that the reunification requirement was arbitrary and capricious and that the delays in adjudication were plainly unlawful as Congress unambiguously intended the adjudication to be expeditious, providing a clear and mandatory deadline of 180 days. The court also entered a permanent injunction, specifically with regard to adjudication timelines. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application was filed by the petitioner. The injunction, though, permitted SIJ petitioners to \u201ctoll\u201d the deadline to respond to a request for evidence. 492 F.Supp.3d 1169.\n\nA month later, the defendants appealed this order to the Ninth Circuit as well (20-36052). Following motions to extend the time to file their briefings, the defendants filed their opening brief on July 20, 2021, to which the plaintiffs responded on September 20. Oral arguments were then scheduled for March 9, 2022. Prior to this, though, the defendants submitted a letter to the court to notify that USCIS anticipated a final rule implicating Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) petitions would be issued in the near future, potentially before oral arguments. Following oral arguments on March 9, the court requested the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez,142 S. Ct. 2057 (2022), which held that injunctive relief was precluded for certain provisions of the INA.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit entered judgment on November 3, 2022, affirming in part and vacating in part the district court\u2019s opinion. The Ninth Circuit determined that the district court had jurisdiction to enter a permanent injunction, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Aleman Gonzalez, noting that the provision of the INA implicated in this case was not one that precluded injunctive relief. However, the court did find that the district court abused its discretion when permitting each and every SIJ petitioner to \u201ctoll\u201d indefinitely Congress\u2019s timeline for adjudicating SIJ petitions. According to the Ninth Circuit panel, the tolling provisions of the injunction were not narrowly tailored to remedy the harm and did not contemplate USCIS\u2019s relevant regulations. As such, this portion of the injunction was vacated. 52 F.4th 821.\n\nFollowing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s official mandate on February 10, 2023, the parties were ordered to submit a joint status report prior to July, proposing amendments to the permanent injunction consistent with the Ninth Circuit's order. Following the parties\u2019 submission of the joint status report, a hearing was held on September 21, 2023.\n\nAn amended permanent injunction was then entered by the district court on September 22, and stated as follows:\n\n\u201cDefendants must adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application is filed by the petitioner\u2026 This timeline is inclusive of any requests for additional evidence or notices of intent to deny that USCIS may issue to a petitioner. USCIS must provide SIJ petitioners with sufficient time prior to the expiration of the 180 days to respond to the request/notice in an effort to complete final adjudication of the SIJ petition in a timely manner. USCIS may not use the issuance of a request for information or notice of intent to deny for the sole purpose of avoiding the statutory deadline for adjudication of an SIJ petition.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs then filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs on December 14, 2023. Briefing deadlines on the matter were extended on multiple occasions as settlement negotiations on the matter continued. On May 22, 2024, the court preliminarily approved the settlement agreement and scheduled a final approval hearing on the matter for September. On September 5, 2024, the final settlement agreement was approved, whereby the defendants agreed to pay the plaintiffs $400,000.\n\nThe case is now considered closed.",

    "target": "On March 5, 2019, plaintiffs\u2014immigrant youth under the age of 21 who applied for Special Immigrant Juvenile status (\u201cSIJ\u201d)\u2014filed a class action lawsuit in the Western District of Washington on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated to challenge the Trump Administration\u2019s policy of refusing to adjudicate their SIJ petitions in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). The complaint was filed on behalf of the following proposed class:\n\n\u201cAll individuals who have been issued predicate SIJS orders by Washington state courts after turning eighteen years old but prior to turning twenty-one years old, and have submitted or will submit SIJS petitions to USCIS prior to turning twenty-one years old.\u201d\n\nFiled against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d), and their respective directors, the complaint alleged that USCIS began denying SIJ applications unless petitioners could show that a state court had the power to return the youth to the custody of their parents. This resulted in USCIS denying petitions to applicants after turning 18 but before the age of 21. \u00a0USCIS also delayed the adjudications of numerous applications. These actions, the complaint claimed, were in violation of the INA\u2019s text. Plaintiffs, thus, sought declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin this unlawful agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). Plaintiffs also alleged, under the APA, that the agency action was arbitrary and capricious; that the new policy was promulgated without notice-and-comment rulemaking; and that action could not be unreasonably delayed beyond the 180 day statutory deadline. Due to the defendant\u2019s duty to adjudicate applications without unreasonable delay, the plaintiffs further sought a writ of mandamus to compel a federal official or agency to adjudicate SIJ applications. The plaintiffs were represented by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. The case was assigned to Judge Robert S. Lasnik.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class and a motion for a preliminary injunction that same day. The State of Washington filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs on March 25, 2019. On July 17, 2019, the court certified the class. 2019 WL 3219418. The court also granted the motion for preliminary injunction. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate outstanding SIJ petitions and to readjudicate cases that were denied on grounds that state courts did not have jurisdiction to \u201creunify\u201d an immigrant with their parents. 387 F.Supp.3d 1208.\n\nFollowing the court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the judgment on August 7, 2019. Subsequently on August 22, the defendants also requested that certain portions of the preliminary injunction be stayed. However, on August 23, the court denied the motion for reconsideration, citing that the defendants offered no new facts or legal authority that would justify reconsideration. 2019 WL 3996850.\n\nGiven the court\u2019s unwillingness to reconsider the order, the defendants then appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit (No. 19-35884) on October 22, 2019. However, on February 28, 2020, the defendants filed an unopposed motion to dismiss the appeal, which was then granted on March 4, 2020.\n\nBack in district court, the plaintiffs then filed a motion for summary judgment on May 1, 2020, which included a request for permanent injunctive relief. The court granted summary judgment on October 5, finding that the reunification requirement was arbitrary and capricious and that the delays in adjudication were plainly unlawful as Congress unambiguously intended the adjudication to be expeditious, providing a clear and mandatory deadline of 180 days. The court also entered a permanent injunction, specifically with regard to adjudication timelines. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application was filed by the petitioner. The injunction, though, permitted SIJ petitioners to \u201ctoll\u201d the deadline to respond to a request for evidence. 492 F.Supp.3d 1169.\n\nA month later, the defendants appealed this order to the Ninth Circuit as well (20-36052). Following motions to extend the time to file their briefings, the defendants filed their opening brief on July 20, 2021, to which the plaintiffs responded on September 20. Oral arguments were then scheduled for March 9, 2022. Prior to this, though, the defendants submitted a letter to the court to notify that USCIS anticipated a final rule implicating Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) petitions would be issued in the near future, potentially before oral arguments. Following oral arguments on March 9, the court requested the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez,142 S. Ct. 2057 (2022), which held that injunctive relief was precluded for certain provisions of the INA.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit entered judgment on November 3, 2022, affirming in part and vacating in part the district court\u2019s opinion. The Ninth Circuit determined that the district court had jurisdiction to enter a permanent injunction, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Aleman Gonzalez, noting that the provision of the INA implicated in this case was not one that precluded injunctive relief. However, the court did find that the district court abused its discretion when permitting each and every SIJ petitioner to \u201ctoll\u201d indefinitely Congress\u2019s timeline for adjudicating SIJ petitions. According to the Ninth Circuit panel, the tolling provisions of the injunction were not narrowly tailored to remedy the harm and did not contemplate USCIS\u2019s relevant regulations. As such, this portion of the injunction was vacated. 52 F.4th 821.\n\nFollowing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s official mandate on February 10, 2023, the parties were ordered to submit a joint status report prior to July, proposing amendments to the permanent injunction consistent with the Ninth Circuit's order. Following the parties\u2019 submission of the joint status report, a hearing was held on September 21, 2023.\n\nAn amended permanent injunction was then entered by the district court on September 22, and stated as follows:\n\n\u201cDefendants must adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application is filed by the petitioner\u2026 This timeline is inclusive of any requests for additional evidence or notices of intent to deny that USCIS may issue to a petitioner. USCIS must provide SIJ petitioners with sufficient time prior to the expiration of the 180 days to respond to the request/notice in an effort to complete final adjudication of the SIJ petition in a timely manner. USCIS may not use the issuance of a request for information or notice of intent to deny for the sole purpose of avoiding the statutory deadline for adjudication of an SIJ petition.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs then filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs on December 14, 2023. Briefing deadlines on the matter were extended on multiple occasions as settlement negotiations on the matter continued. On May 22, 2024, the court preliminarily approved the settlement agreement and scheduled a final approval hearing on the matter for September. On September 5, 2024, the final settlement agreement was approved, whereby the defendants agreed to pay the plaintiffs $400,000.\n\nThe case is now considered closed.",

The State of Washington filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs on March 25, 2019. On July 17, 2019, the court certified the class. 2019 WL 3219418. The court also granted the motion for preliminary injunction. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate outstanding SIJ petitions and to readjudicate cases that were denied on grounds that state courts did not have jurisdiction to \u201creunify\u201d an immigrant with their parents. 387 F.Supp.3d 1208.\n\nFollowing the court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the judgment on August 7, 2019. Subsequently on August 22, the defendants also requested that certain portions of the preliminary injunction be stayed. However, on August 23, the court denied the motion for reconsideration, citing that the defendants offered no new facts or legal authority that would justify reconsideration. 2019 WL 3996850.\n\nGiven the court\u2019s unwillingness to reconsider the order, the defendants then appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit (No. 19-35884) on October 22, 2019. However, on February 28, 2020, the defendants filed an unopposed motion to dismiss the appeal, which was then granted on March 4, 2020.\n\nBack in district court, the plaintiffs then filed a motion for summary judgment on May 1, 2020, which included a request for permanent injunctive relief. The court granted summary judgment on October 5, finding that the reunification requirement was arbitrary and capricious and that the delays in adjudication were plainly unlawful as Congress unambiguously intended the adjudication to be expeditious, providing a clear and mandatory deadline of 180 days. The court also entered a permanent injunction, specifically with regard to adjudication timelines. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application was filed by the petitioner. The injunction, though, permitted SIJ petitioners to \u201ctoll\u201d the deadline to respond to a request for evidence. 492 F.Supp.3d 1169.\n\nA month later, the defendants appealed this order to the Ninth Circuit as well (20-36052). Following motions to extend the time to file their briefings, the defendants filed their opening brief on July 20, 2021, to which the plaintiffs responded on September 20. Oral arguments were then scheduled for March 9, 2022. Prior to this, though, the defendants submitted a letter to the court to notify that USCIS anticipated a final rule implicating Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) petitions would be issued in the near future, potentially before oral arguments. Following oral arguments on March 9, the court requested the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez,142 S. Ct. 2057 (2022), which held that injunctive relief was precluded for certain provisions of the INA.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit entered judgment on November 3, 2022, affirming in part and vacating in part the district court\u2019s opinion. The Ninth Circuit determined that the district court had jurisdiction to enter a permanent injunction, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Aleman Gonzalez, noting that the provision of the INA implicated in this case was not one that precluded injunctive relief. However, the court did find that the district court abused its discretion when permitting each and every SIJ petitioner to \u201ctoll\u201d indefinitely Congress\u2019s timeline for adjudicating SIJ petitions. According to the Ninth Circuit panel, the tolling provisions of the injunction were not narrowly tailored to remedy the harm and did not contemplate USCIS\u2019s relevant regulations. As such, this portion of the injunction was vacated. 52 F.4th 821.\n\nFollowing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s official mandate on February 10, 2023, the parties were ordered to submit a joint status report prior to July, proposing amendments to the permanent injunction consistent with the Ninth Circuit's order. Following the parties\u2019 submission of the joint status report, a hearing was held on September 21, 2023.\n\nAn amended permanent injunction was then entered by the district court on September 22, and stated as follows:\n\n\u201cDefendants must adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application is filed by the petitioner\u2026 This timeline is inclusive of any requests for additional evidence or notices of intent to deny that USCIS may issue to a petitioner. USCIS must provide SIJ petitioners with sufficient time prior to the expiration of the 180 days to respond to the request/notice in an effort to complete final adjudication of the SIJ petition in a timely manner. USCIS may not use the issuance of a request for information or notice of intent to deny for the sole purpose of avoiding the statutory deadline for adjudication of an SIJ petition.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs then filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs on December 14, 2023. Briefing deadlines on the matter were extended on multiple occasions as settlement negotiations on the matter continued. On May 22, 2024, the court preliminarily approved the settlement agreement and scheduled a final approval hearing on the matter for September. On September 5, 2024, the final settlement agreement was approved, whereby the defendants agreed to pay the plaintiffs $400,000.\n\nThe case is now considered closed.",

    "target": "On March 5, 2019, plaintiffs\u2014immigrant youth under the age of 21 who applied for Special Immigrant Juvenile status (\u201cSIJ\u201d)\u2014filed a class action lawsuit in the Western District of Washington on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated to challenge the Trump Administration\u2019s policy of refusing to adjudicate their SIJ petitions in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). The complaint was filed on behalf of the following proposed class:\n\n\u201cAll individuals who have been issued predicate SIJS orders by Washington state courts after turning eighteen years old but prior to turning twenty-one years old, and have submitted or will submit SIJS petitions to USCIS prior to turning twenty-one years old.\u201d\n\nFiled against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d), and their respective directors, the complaint alleged that USCIS began denying SIJ applications unless petitioners could show that a state court had the power to return the youth to the custody of their parents. This resulted in USCIS denying petitions to applicants after turning 18 but before the age of 21. \u00a0USCIS also delayed the adjudications of numerous applications. These actions, the complaint claimed, were in violation of the INA\u2019s text. Plaintiffs, thus, sought declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin this unlawful agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). Plaintiffs also alleged, under the APA, that the agency action was arbitrary and capricious; that the new policy was promulgated without notice-and-comment rulemaking; and that action could not be unreasonably delayed beyond the 180 day statutory deadline. Due to the defendant\u2019s duty to adjudicate applications without unreasonable delay, the plaintiffs further sought a writ of mandamus to compel a federal official or agency to adjudicate SIJ applications.

The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate outstanding SIJ petitions and to readjudicate cases that were denied on grounds that state courts did not have jurisdiction to \u201creunify\u201d an immigrant with their parents. 387 F.Supp.3d 1208.\n\nFollowing the court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the judgment on August 7, 2019. Subsequently on August 22, the defendants also requested that certain portions of the preliminary injunction be stayed. However, on August 23, the court denied the motion for reconsideration, citing that the defendants offered no new facts or legal authority that would justify reconsideration. 2019 WL 3996850.\n\nGiven the court\u2019s unwillingness to reconsider the order, the defendants then appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit (No. 19-35884) on October 22, 2019. However, on February 28, 2020, the defendants filed an unopposed motion to dismiss the appeal, which was then granted on March 4, 2020.\n\nBack in district court, the plaintiffs then filed a motion for summary judgment on May 1, 2020, which included a request for permanent injunctive relief. The court granted summary judgment on October 5, finding that the reunification requirement was arbitrary and capricious and that the delays in adjudication were plainly unlawful as Congress unambiguously intended the adjudication to be expeditious, providing a clear and mandatory deadline of 180 days. The court also entered a permanent injunction, specifically with regard to adjudication timelines. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application was filed by the petitioner. The injunction, though, permitted SIJ petitioners to \u201ctoll\u201d the deadline to respond to a request for evidence. 492 F.Supp.3d 1169.\n\nA month later, the defendants appealed this order to the Ninth Circuit as well (20-36052). Following motions to extend the time to file their briefings, the defendants filed their opening brief on July 20, 2021, to which the plaintiffs responded on September 20. Oral arguments were then scheduled for March 9, 2022. Prior to this, though, the defendants submitted a letter to the court to notify that USCIS anticipated a final rule implicating Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) petitions would be issued in the near future, potentially before oral arguments. Following oral arguments on March 9, the court requested the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez,142 S. Ct. 2057 (2022), which held that injunctive relief was precluded for certain provisions of the INA.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit entered judgment on November 3, 2022, affirming in part and vacating in part the district court\u2019s opinion. The Ninth Circuit determined that the district court had jurisdiction to enter a permanent injunction, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Aleman Gonzalez, noting that the provision of the INA implicated in this case was not one that precluded injunctive relief. However, the court did find that the district court abused its discretion when permitting each and every SIJ petitioner to \u201ctoll\u201d indefinitely Congress\u2019s timeline for adjudicating SIJ petitions. According to the Ninth Circuit panel, the tolling provisions of the injunction were not narrowly tailored to remedy the harm and did not contemplate USCIS\u2019s relevant regulations. As such, this portion of the injunction was vacated. 52 F.4th 821.\n\nFollowing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s official mandate on February 10, 2023, the parties were ordered to submit a joint status report prior to July, proposing amendments to the permanent injunction consistent with the Ninth Circuit's order. Following the parties\u2019 submission of the joint status report, a hearing was held on September 21, 2023.\n\nAn amended permanent injunction was then entered by the district court on September 22, and stated as follows:\n\n\u201cDefendants must adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application is filed by the petitioner\u2026 This timeline is inclusive of any requests for additional evidence or notices of intent to deny that USCIS may issue to a petitioner. USCIS must provide SIJ petitioners with sufficient time prior to the expiration of the 180 days to respond to the request/notice in an effort to complete final adjudication of the SIJ petition in a timely manner. USCIS may not use the issuance of a request for information or notice of intent to deny for the sole purpose of avoiding the statutory deadline for adjudication of an SIJ petition.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs then filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs on December 14, 2023. Briefing deadlines on the matter were extended on multiple occasions as settlement negotiations on the matter continued. On May 22, 2024, the court preliminarily approved the settlement agreement and scheduled a final approval hearing on the matter for September. On September 5, 2024, the final settlement agreement was approved, whereby the defendants agreed to pay the plaintiffs $400,000.\n\nThe case is now considered closed.",

    "target": "On March 5, 2019, plaintiffs\u2014immigrant youth under the age of 21 who applied for Special Immigrant Juvenile status (\u201cSIJ\u201d)\u2014filed a class action lawsuit in the Western District of Washington on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated to challenge the Trump Administration\u2019s policy of refusing to adjudicate their SIJ petitions in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). The complaint was filed on behalf of the following proposed class:\n\n\u201cAll individuals who have been issued predicate SIJS orders by Washington state courts after turning eighteen years old but prior to turning twenty-one years old, and have submitted or will submit SIJS petitions to USCIS prior to turning twenty-one years old.\u201d\n\nFiled against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d), and their respective directors, the complaint alleged that USCIS began denying SIJ applications unless petitioners could show that a state court had the power to return the youth to the custody of their parents. This resulted in USCIS denying petitions to applicants after turning 18 but before the age of 21. \u00a0USCIS also delayed the adjudications of numerous applications. These actions, the complaint claimed, were in violation of the INA\u2019s text. Plaintiffs, thus, sought declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin this unlawful agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). Plaintiffs also alleged, under the APA, that the agency action was arbitrary and capricious; that the new policy was promulgated without notice-and-comment rulemaking; and that action could not be unreasonably delayed beyond the 180 day statutory deadline. Due to the defendant\u2019s duty to adjudicate applications without unreasonable delay, the plaintiffs further sought a writ of mandamus to compel a federal official or agency to adjudicate SIJ applications. The plaintiffs were represented by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. The case was assigned to Judge Robert S. Lasnik.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class and a motion for a preliminary injunction that same day. The State of Washington filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs on March 25, 2019. On July 17, 2019, the court certified the class. 2019 WL 3219418. The court also granted the motion for preliminary injunction. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate outstanding SIJ petitions and to readjudicate cases that were denied on grounds that state courts did not have jurisdiction to \u201creunify\u201d an immigrant with their parents. 387 F.Supp.3d 1208.\n\nFollowing the court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the judgment on August 7, 2019. Subsequently on August 22, the defendants also requested that certain portions of the preliminary injunction be stayed. However, on August 23, the court denied the motion for reconsideration, citing that the defendants offered no new facts or legal authority that would justify reconsideration. 2019 WL 3996850.\n\nGiven the court\u2019s unwillingness to reconsider the order, the defendants then appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit (No. 19-35884) on October 22, 2019.

    "target": "On March 5, 2019, plaintiffs\u2014immigrant youth under the age of 21 who applied for Special Immigrant Juvenile status (\u201cSIJ\u201d)\u2014filed a class action lawsuit in the Western District of Washington on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated to challenge the Trump Administration\u2019s policy of refusing to adjudicate their SIJ petitions in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). The complaint was filed on behalf of the following proposed class:\n\n\u201cAll individuals who have been issued predicate SIJS orders by Washington state courts after turning eighteen years old but prior to turning twenty-one years old, and have submitted or will submit SIJS petitions to USCIS prior to turning twenty-one years old.\u201d\n\nFiled against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d), and their respective directors, the complaint alleged that USCIS began denying SIJ applications unless petitioners could show that a state court had the power to return the youth to the custody of their parents. This resulted in USCIS denying petitions to applicants after turning 18 but before the age of 21. \u00a0USCIS also delayed the adjudications of numerous applications. These actions, the complaint claimed, were in violation of the INA\u2019s text. Plaintiffs, thus, sought declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin this unlawful agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). Plaintiffs also alleged, under the APA, that the agency action was arbitrary and capricious; that the new policy was promulgated without notice-and-comment rulemaking; and that action could not be unreasonably delayed beyond the 180 day statutory deadline. Due to the defendant\u2019s duty to adjudicate applications without unreasonable delay, the plaintiffs further sought a writ of mandamus to compel a federal official or agency to adjudicate SIJ applications. The plaintiffs were represented by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. The case was assigned to Judge Robert S. Lasnik.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class and a motion for a preliminary injunction that same day. The State of Washington filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs on March 25, 2019. On July 17, 2019, the court certified the class. 2019 WL 3219418. The court also granted the motion for preliminary injunction. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate outstanding SIJ petitions and to readjudicate cases that were denied on grounds that state courts did not have jurisdiction to \u201creunify\u201d an immigrant with their parents. 387 F.Supp.3d 1208.\n\nFollowing the court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the judgment on August 7, 2019. Subsequently on August 22, the defendants also requested that certain portions of the preliminary injunction be stayed. However, on August 23, the court denied the motion for reconsideration, citing that the defendants offered no new facts or legal authority that would justify reconsideration. 2019 WL 3996850.\n\nGiven the court\u2019s unwillingness to reconsider the order, the defendants then appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit (No. 19-35884) on October 22, 2019. However, on February 28, 2020, the defendants filed an unopposed motion to dismiss the appeal, which was then granted on March 4, 2020.\n\nBack in district court, the plaintiffs then filed a motion for summary judgment on May 1, 2020, which included a request for permanent injunctive relief. The court granted summary judgment on October 5, finding that the reunification requirement was arbitrary and capricious and that the delays in adjudication were plainly unlawful as Congress unambiguously intended the adjudication to be expeditious, providing a clear and mandatory deadline of 180 days. The court also entered a permanent injunction, specifically with regard to adjudication timelines. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application was filed by the petitioner. The injunction, though, permitted SIJ petitioners to \u201ctoll\u201d the deadline to respond to a request for evidence. 492 F.Supp.3d 1169.\n\nA month later, the defendants appealed this order to the Ninth Circuit as well (20-36052). Following motions to extend the time to file their briefings, the defendants filed their opening brief on July 20, 2021, to which the plaintiffs responded on September 20. Oral arguments were then scheduled for March 9, 2022. Prior to this, though, the defendants submitted a letter to the court to notify that USCIS anticipated a final rule implicating Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) petitions would be issued in the near future, potentially before oral arguments. Following oral arguments on March 9, the court requested the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez,142 S. Ct. 2057 (2022), which held that injunctive relief was precluded for certain provisions of the INA.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit entered judgment on November 3, 2022, affirming in part and vacating in part the district court\u2019s opinion. The Ninth Circuit determined that the district court had jurisdiction to enter a permanent injunction, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Aleman Gonzalez, noting that the provision of the INA implicated in this case was not one that precluded injunctive relief. However, the court did find that the district court abused its discretion when permitting each and every SIJ petitioner to \u201ctoll\u201d indefinitely Congress\u2019s timeline for adjudicating SIJ petitions. According to the Ninth Circuit panel, the tolling provisions of the injunction were not narrowly tailored to remedy the harm and did not contemplate USCIS\u2019s relevant regulations. As such, this portion of the injunction was vacated. 52 F.4th 821.\n\nFollowing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s official mandate on February 10, 2023, the parties were ordered to submit a joint status report prior to July, proposing amendments to the permanent injunction consistent with the Ninth Circuit's order. Following the parties\u2019 submission of the joint status report, a hearing was held on September 21, 2023.\n\nAn amended permanent injunction was then entered by the district court on September 22, and stated as follows:\n\n\u201cDefendants must adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application is filed by the petitioner\u2026 This timeline is inclusive of any requests for additional evidence or notices of intent to deny that USCIS may issue to a petitioner. USCIS must provide SIJ petitioners with sufficient time prior to the expiration of the 180 days to respond to the request/notice in an effort to complete final adjudication of the SIJ petition in a timely manner. USCIS may not use the issuance of a request for information or notice of intent to deny for the sole purpose of avoiding the statutory deadline for adjudication of an SIJ petition.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs then filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs on December 14, 2023. Briefing deadlines on the matter were extended on multiple occasions as settlement negotiations on the matter continued. On May 22, 2024, the court preliminarily approved the settlement agreement and scheduled a final approval hearing on the matter for September. On September 5, 2024, the final settlement agreement was approved, whereby the defendants agreed to pay the plaintiffs $400,000.\n\nThe case is now considered closed.",
