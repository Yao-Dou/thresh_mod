    "target": "This case challenges a federal reporting rule requiring certain money services businesses (MSBs) near the U.S.\u2013Mexico border to report small cash transactions. On March 11, 2025, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued the Southwest Border Geographic Targeting Order (GTO), requiring MSBs in thirty zip codes near the southern border to report each transaction, or series of transactions, by or for any one person totaling more than $200 in currency for money transfers to or from Mexico. This reporting threshold was significantly lower than the $10,000 reporting requirement applicable elsewhere.\n\nOn May 30, 2025, two Texas-based businesses, Valuta Corporation, Inc. and Payan's Fuel Center, Inc., filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The plaintiffs sued the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and its Director Andrea Gacki, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and its Secretary, and the U.S. Attorney General, claiming violations of the Fourth Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Non-Delegation Doctrine. Represented by the Institute for Justice, the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the GTO and declaratory relief declaring the order unlawful. Judge Leon Schydlower presides over the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted that the GTO violated the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures by requiring the collection and reporting of private financial data without a warrant or probable cause. They further argued that the GTO violated the Administrative Procedure Act because FinCEN had failed to provide the public notice and comment period required for such a significant regulatory action. Finally, the plaintiffs invoked the Non-Delegation Doctrine, contending that Congress had improperly delegated its legislative authority to FinCEN, permitting the agency to create a new reporting requirement without sufficient guidance or limits.\n\nOn May 30, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order to halt enforcement of the GTO. They alleged that the order inflicted \u201cprofound irreparable harms\u201d on their businesses, including \u201ccrushing costs\u201d from a surge in paperwork, with one plaintiff filing roughly 1,600 reports in a single month compared to 123 in the prior year. They also cited \u201cskyrocketing labor costs\u201d and the threat of \u201cruinous fines\u201d for non-compliance. In addition, they asserted that the GTO caused the loss of customers and revenue as patrons took their business to competitors in untargeted ZIP codes to avoid the new reporting requirements.\n\nFinding that the equities and public interest favored the plaintiffs, the court issued a TRO on June 24, 2025, halting enforcement of the GTO until July 8. 2025 WL 2389430. Judge Schydlower concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the GTO was arbitrary and capricious, emphasizing the government\u2019s failure to address how cartel members could evade the rule by crossing into untargeted ZIP codes and how the measure would drive customers away from covered businesses. The court found that the plaintiffs faced immediate and irreparable harm, including the threat of business closure, reputational injury, and loss of customers and goodwill. On July 2, the court extended the TRO for an additional fourteen days, through July 22, 2025.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for class certification, proposing to represent all money services businesses that were not already plaintiffs in another case and that operated in the specific ZIP codes targeted by the Border GTO.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a combined motion for summary judgment, final judgment under Rule 65(a)(2), and a preliminary injunction. They urged the court to end the unlawful agency action, arguing that the appropriate final remedy under the Administrative Procedure Act was vacatur, which would nullify the GTO for all businesses, not only the plaintiffs.\n\nOn July 22, 2025, the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction, the same day the TRO was set to expire. The text order barred the defendants from enforcing, implementing, or otherwise giving effect to the GTO.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenges a federal reporting rule requiring certain money services businesses (MSBs) near the U.S.\u2013Mexico border to report small cash transactions. On March 11, 2025, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued the Southwest Border Geographic Targeting Order (GTO), requiring MSBs in thirty zip codes near the southern border to report each transaction, or series of transactions, by or for any one person totaling more than $200 in currency for money transfers to or from Mexico. This reporting threshold was significantly lower than the $10,000 reporting requirement applicable elsewhere.\n\nOn May 30, 2025, two Texas-based businesses, Valuta Corporation, Inc. and Payan's Fuel Center, Inc., filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The plaintiffs sued the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and its Director Andrea Gacki, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and its Secretary, and the U.S. Attorney General, claiming violations of the Fourth Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Non-Delegation Doctrine. Represented by the Institute for Justice, the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the GTO and declaratory relief declaring the order unlawful. Judge Leon Schydlower presides over the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted that the GTO violated the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures by requiring the collection and reporting of private financial data without a warrant or probable cause. They further argued that the GTO violated the Administrative Procedure Act because FinCEN had failed to provide the public notice and comment period required for such a significant regulatory action. Finally, the plaintiffs invoked the Non-Delegation Doctrine, contending that Congress had improperly delegated its legislative authority to FinCEN, permitting the agency to create a new reporting requirement without sufficient guidance or limits.\n\nOn May 30, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order to halt enforcement of the GTO. They alleged that the order inflicted \u201cprofound irreparable harms\u201d on their businesses, including \u201ccrushing costs\u201d from a surge in paperwork, with one plaintiff filing roughly 1,600 reports in a single month compared to 123 in the prior year. They also cited \u201cskyrocketing labor costs\u201d and the threat of \u201cruinous fines\u201d for non-compliance. In addition, they asserted that the GTO caused the loss of customers and revenue as patrons took their business to competitors in untargeted ZIP codes to avoid the new reporting requirements.\n\nFinding that the equities and public interest favored the plaintiffs, the court issued a TRO on June 24, 2025, halting enforcement of the GTO until July 8. 2025 WL 2389430. Judge Schydlower concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the GTO was arbitrary and capricious, emphasizing the government\u2019s failure to address how cartel members could evade the rule by crossing into untargeted ZIP codes and how the measure would drive customers away from covered businesses. The court found that the plaintiffs faced immediate and irreparable harm, including the threat of business closure, reputational injury, and loss of customers and goodwill. On July 2, the court extended the TRO for an additional fourteen days, through July 22, 2025.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for class certification, proposing to represent all money services businesses that were not already plaintiffs in another case and that operated in the specific ZIP codes targeted by the Border GTO.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a combined motion for summary judgment, final judgment under Rule 65(a)(2), and a preliminary injunction. They urged the court to end the unlawful agency action, arguing that the appropriate final remedy under the Administrative Procedure Act was vacatur, which would nullify the GTO for all businesses, not only the plaintiffs.\n\nOn July 22, 2025, the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction, the same day the TRO was set to expire. The text order barred the defendants from enforcing, implementing, or otherwise giving effect to the GTO.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenges a federal reporting rule requiring certain money services businesses (MSBs) near the U.S.\u2013Mexico border to report small cash transactions. On March 11, 2025, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued the Southwest Border Geographic Targeting Order (GTO), requiring MSBs in thirty zip codes near the southern border to report each transaction, or series of transactions, by or for any one person totaling more than $200 in currency for money transfers to or from Mexico. This reporting threshold was significantly lower than the $10,000 reporting requirement applicable elsewhere.\n\nOn May 30, 2025, two Texas-based businesses, Valuta Corporation, Inc. and Payan's Fuel Center, Inc., filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The plaintiffs sued the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and its Director Andrea Gacki, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and its Secretary, and the U.S. Attorney General, claiming violations of the Fourth Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Non-Delegation Doctrine. Represented by the Institute for Justice, the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the GTO and declaratory relief declaring the order unlawful. Judge Leon Schydlower presides over the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted that the GTO violated the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures by requiring the collection and reporting of private financial data without a warrant or probable cause. They further argued that the GTO violated the Administrative Procedure Act because FinCEN had failed to provide the public notice and comment period required for such a significant regulatory action. Finally, the plaintiffs invoked the Non-Delegation Doctrine, contending that Congress had improperly delegated its legislative authority to FinCEN, permitting the agency to create a new reporting requirement without sufficient guidance or limits.\n\nOn May 30, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order to halt enforcement of the GTO. They alleged that the order inflicted \u201cprofound irreparable harms\u201d on their businesses, including \u201ccrushing costs\u201d from a surge in paperwork, with one plaintiff filing roughly 1,600 reports in a single month compared to 123 in the prior year. They also cited \u201cskyrocketing labor costs\u201d and the threat of \u201cruinous fines\u201d for non-compliance. In addition, they asserted that the GTO caused the loss of customers and revenue as patrons took their business to competitors in untargeted ZIP codes to avoid the new reporting requirements.\n\nFinding that the equities and public interest favored the plaintiffs, the court issued a TRO on June 24, 2025, halting enforcement of the GTO until July 8. 2025 WL 2389430. Judge Schydlower concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the GTO was arbitrary and capricious, emphasizing the government\u2019s failure to address how cartel members could evade the rule by crossing into untargeted ZIP codes and how the measure would drive customers away from covered businesses. The court found that the plaintiffs faced immediate and irreparable harm, including the threat of business closure, reputational injury, and loss of customers and goodwill. On July 2, the court extended the TRO for an additional fourteen days, through July 22, 2025.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for class certification, proposing to represent all money services businesses that were not already plaintiffs in another case and that operated in the specific ZIP codes targeted by the Border GTO.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a combined motion for summary judgment, final judgment under Rule 65(a)(2), and a preliminary injunction. They urged the court to end the unlawful agency action, arguing that the appropriate final remedy under the Administrative Procedure Act was vacatur, which would nullify the GTO for all businesses, not only the plaintiffs.\n\nOn July 22, 2025, the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction, the same day the TRO was set to expire. The text order barred the defendants from enforcing, implementing, or otherwise giving effect to the GTO.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenges a federal reporting rule requiring certain money services businesses (MSBs) near the U.S.\u2013Mexico border to report small cash transactions. On March 11, 2025, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued the Southwest Border Geographic Targeting Order (GTO), requiring MSBs in thirty zip codes near the southern border to report each transaction, or series of transactions, by or for any one person totaling more than $200 in currency for money transfers to or from Mexico. This reporting threshold was significantly lower than the $10,000 reporting requirement applicable elsewhere.\n\nOn May 30, 2025, two Texas-based businesses, Valuta Corporation, Inc. and Payan's Fuel Center, Inc., filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The plaintiffs sued the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and its Director Andrea Gacki, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and its Secretary, and the U.S. Attorney General, claiming violations of the Fourth Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Non-Delegation Doctrine. Represented by the Institute for Justice, the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the GTO and declaratory relief declaring the order unlawful. Judge Leon Schydlower presides over the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted that the GTO violated the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures by requiring the collection and reporting of private financial data without a warrant or probable cause. They further argued that the GTO violated the Administrative Procedure Act because FinCEN had failed to provide the public notice and comment period required for such a significant regulatory action. Finally, the plaintiffs invoked the Non-Delegation Doctrine, contending that Congress had improperly delegated its legislative authority to FinCEN, permitting the agency to create a new reporting requirement without sufficient guidance or limits.\n\nOn May 30, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order to halt enforcement of the GTO. They alleged that the order inflicted \u201cprofound irreparable harms\u201d on their businesses, including \u201ccrushing costs\u201d from a surge in paperwork, with one plaintiff filing roughly 1,600 reports in a single month compared to 123 in the prior year. They also cited \u201cskyrocketing labor costs\u201d and the threat of \u201cruinous fines\u201d for non-compliance. In addition, they asserted that the GTO caused the loss of customers and revenue as patrons took their business to competitors in untargeted ZIP codes to avoid the new reporting requirements.\n\nFinding that the equities and public interest favored the plaintiffs, the court issued a TRO on June 24, 2025, halting enforcement of the GTO until July 8. 2025 WL 2389430. Judge Schydlower concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the GTO was arbitrary and capricious, emphasizing the government\u2019s failure to address how cartel members could evade the rule by crossing into untargeted ZIP codes and how the measure would drive customers away from covered businesses. The court found that the plaintiffs faced immediate and irreparable harm, including the threat of business closure, reputational injury, and loss of customers and goodwill. On July 2, the court extended the TRO for an additional fourteen days, through July 22, 2025.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for class certification, proposing to represent all money services businesses that were not already plaintiffs in another case and that operated in the specific ZIP codes targeted by the Border GTO.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a combined motion for summary judgment, final judgment under Rule 65(a)(2), and a preliminary injunction. They urged the court to end the unlawful agency action, arguing that the appropriate final remedy under the Administrative Procedure Act was vacatur, which would nullify the GTO for all businesses, not only the plaintiffs.\n\nOn July 22, 2025, the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction, the same day the TRO was set to expire. The text order barred the defendants from enforcing, implementing, or otherwise giving effect to the GTO.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",
