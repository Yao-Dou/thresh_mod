    "target": "This case challenges federal agencies' imposition of alleged unlawful funding conditions on federal grants related to domestic violence, sexual assault, and homelessness services.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, several nonprofit organizations that receive federal grants to serve victims of domestic violence, victims of sexual assault, and homeless individuals filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary; the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and its Acting Assistant Secretary; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its Acting Director; the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) and its Administrator; and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and its Secretary. The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act, the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and were ultra vires. Judge Melissa R. DuBose presides over the case.\n\nPlaintiffs challenged funding restrictions imposed by the Trump Administration, including anti-Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEI/DEIA) requirements; \"Gender Ideology\" conditions, as defined in Executive Order 14168; and a \"HUD Abortion Condition\" that restricts the use of grant funds for elective abortions, following Executive Order 14182. Plaintiffs claimed these restrictions were ideologically motivated and designed to advance the Administration\u2019s agenda, rather than to further the statutory purposes of the underlying grant programs. They claimed the conditions were unlawful, arbitrary and capricious, and untethered to the authorizing statutes, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nPlaintiffs argued that these conditions placed them in an untenable position: either fundamentally alter their programming or lose essential federal funding\u2014jeopardizing critical services and displacing survivors from safe housing. They further contended that the executive branch unilaterally imposed these restrictions without congressional authorization, violating the separation of powers.\n\nIn addition, plaintiffs claimed the conditions were unconstitutionally vague, offering no clear guidance on prohibited conduct or enforcement standards, and thereby opening the door to arbitrary and discriminatory application. They also asserted that the rules violated the First Amendment by compelling grantees to endorse the Administration\u2019s views on gender and chilling speech related to DEI. Finally, they argued that the restrictions conflicted with federal statutory mandates requiring services for \u201cunderserved\u201d and \u201cracial and ethnic minority\u201d populations and were adopted without complying with the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s procedural requirements.\n\nRepresented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought a declaration that the new conditions were unlawful, as well as an order vacating and setting them aside, along with the defendants\u2019 decision to include them in individual award programs. They also sought a stay of the conditions as applied in agency policies, funding opportunities, and grants, and requested preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the defendants from including or enforcing the conditions in any funding notices or awards.\n\nAlongside the complaint, plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order to block enforcement of the new conditions. They argued that immediate relief was necessary to prevent irreparable harm to the communities they serve, including the loss of housing and essential services. They reiterated that the conditions unlawfully compelled speech, threatened the stability of life-saving programs, and created confusion due to vague and unclear standards.\n\nA hearing on the motion for a temporary restraining order was held on July 24, 2025, and Judge DuBose granted the motion on July 28. 2025 WL 2104144. The court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed, at risk of immediate irreparable harm, and entitled to access their grant funding without the new HUD and HHS conditions after weighing the hardships and public interest. The temporary restraining order barred HUD from enforcing conditions related to gender ideology and elective abortions for Continuums of Care grants, and barred HHS and ACF from enforcing a condition requiring Family Violence Prevention and Services Act grant recipients to advance or promote DEI or related ideologies. The court declared these conditions null, void, and rescinded, and ordered defendants to take immediate compliance steps.\n\nOn August 4, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of the challenged conditions. They specifically targeted HUD policies that barred grantees from using funds to promote \u201cgender ideology,\u201d as defined in Executive Order 14168; prohibited the use of funds for elective abortions under Executive Order 14182; and required certification that DEI-related activities would not violate federal antidiscrimination laws. They also challenged HHS policies requiring grantees to certify that they do not operate programs promoting DEI or \u201cdiscriminatory equity ideology,\u201d and to affirm compliance with Executive Order 14168 as a condition of Title IX funding.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, Judge DuBose issued a revised TRO that clarified the scope of the earlier order and restated the specific prohibitions against HUD, HHS, and ACF in enforcing the challenged grant conditions. 2025 WL 2262896. Later that day, the court granted a third motion to amend the TRO, and the parties were instructed to appear for a virtual chambers conference on August 8. 2025 WL 2301661.\n\nA hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for September 4, 2025.",

    "target": "This case challenges federal agencies' imposition of alleged unlawful funding conditions on federal grants related to domestic violence, sexual assault, and homelessness services.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, several nonprofit organizations that receive federal grants to serve victims of domestic violence, victims of sexual assault, and homeless individuals filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary; the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and its Acting Assistant Secretary; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its Acting Director; the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) and its Administrator; and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and its Secretary. The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act, the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and were ultra vires. Judge Melissa R. DuBose presides over the case.\n\nPlaintiffs challenged funding restrictions imposed by the Trump Administration, including anti-Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEI/DEIA) requirements; \"Gender Ideology\" conditions, as defined in Executive Order 14168; and a \"HUD Abortion Condition\" that restricts the use of grant funds for elective abortions, following Executive Order 14182. Plaintiffs claimed these restrictions were ideologically motivated and designed to advance the Administration\u2019s agenda, rather than to further the statutory purposes of the underlying grant programs. They claimed the conditions were unlawful, arbitrary and capricious, and untethered to the authorizing statutes, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nPlaintiffs argued that these conditions placed them in an untenable position: either fundamentally alter their programming or lose essential federal funding\u2014jeopardizing critical services and displacing survivors from safe housing. They further contended that the executive branch unilaterally imposed these restrictions without congressional authorization, violating the separation of powers.\n\nIn addition, plaintiffs claimed the conditions were unconstitutionally vague, offering no clear guidance on prohibited conduct or enforcement standards, and thereby opening the door to arbitrary and discriminatory application. They also asserted that the rules violated the First Amendment by compelling grantees to endorse the Administration\u2019s views on gender and chilling speech related to DEI. Finally, they argued that the restrictions conflicted with federal statutory mandates requiring services for \u201cunderserved\u201d and \u201cracial and ethnic minority\u201d populations and were adopted without complying with the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s procedural requirements.\n\nRepresented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought a declaration that the new conditions were unlawful, as well as an order vacating and setting them aside, along with the defendants\u2019 decision to include them in individual award programs. They also sought a stay of the conditions as applied in agency policies, funding opportunities, and grants, and requested preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the defendants from including or enforcing the conditions in any funding notices or awards.\n\nAlongside the complaint, plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order to block enforcement of the new conditions. They argued that immediate relief was necessary to prevent irreparable harm to the communities they serve, including the loss of housing and essential services. They reiterated that the conditions unlawfully compelled speech, threatened the stability of life-saving programs, and created confusion due to vague and unclear standards.\n\nA hearing on the motion for a temporary restraining order was held on July 24, 2025, and Judge DuBose granted the motion on July 28. 2025 WL 2104144. The court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed, at risk of immediate irreparable harm, and entitled to access their grant funding without the new HUD and HHS conditions after weighing the hardships and public interest. The temporary restraining order barred HUD from enforcing conditions related to gender ideology and elective abortions for Continuums of Care grants, and barred HHS and ACF from enforcing a condition requiring Family Violence Prevention and Services Act grant recipients to advance or promote DEI or related ideologies. The court declared these conditions null, void, and rescinded, and ordered defendants to take immediate compliance steps.\n\nOn August 4, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of the challenged conditions. They specifically targeted HUD policies that barred grantees from using funds to promote \u201cgender ideology,\u201d as defined in Executive Order 14168; prohibited the use of funds for elective abortions under Executive Order 14182; and required certification that DEI-related activities would not violate federal antidiscrimination laws. They also challenged HHS policies requiring grantees to certify that they do not operate programs promoting DEI or \u201cdiscriminatory equity ideology,\u201d and to affirm compliance with Executive Order 14168 as a condition of Title IX funding.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, Judge DuBose issued a revised TRO that clarified the scope of the earlier order and restated the specific prohibitions against HUD, HHS, and ACF in enforcing the challenged grant conditions. 2025 WL 2262896. Later that day, the court granted a third motion to amend the TRO, and the parties were instructed to appear for a virtual chambers conference on August 8. 2025 WL 2301661.\n\nA hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for September 4, 2025.",

    "target": "This case challenges federal agencies' imposition of alleged unlawful funding conditions on federal grants related to domestic violence, sexual assault, and homelessness services.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, several nonprofit organizations that receive federal grants to serve victims of domestic violence, victims of sexual assault, and homeless individuals filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary; the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and its Acting Assistant Secretary; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its Acting Director; the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) and its Administrator; and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and its Secretary. The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act, the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and were ultra vires. Judge Melissa R. DuBose presides over the case.\n\nPlaintiffs challenged funding restrictions imposed by the Trump Administration, including anti-Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEI/DEIA) requirements; \"Gender Ideology\" conditions, as defined in Executive Order 14168; and a \"HUD Abortion Condition\" that restricts the use of grant funds for elective abortions, following Executive Order 14182. Plaintiffs claimed these restrictions were ideologically motivated and designed to advance the Administration\u2019s agenda, rather than to further the statutory purposes of the underlying grant programs. They claimed the conditions were unlawful, arbitrary and capricious, and untethered to the authorizing statutes, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nPlaintiffs argued that these conditions placed them in an untenable position: either fundamentally alter their programming or lose essential federal funding\u2014jeopardizing critical services and displacing survivors from safe housing. They further contended that the executive branch unilaterally imposed these restrictions without congressional authorization, violating the separation of powers.\n\nIn addition, plaintiffs claimed the conditions were unconstitutionally vague, offering no clear guidance on prohibited conduct or enforcement standards, and thereby opening the door to arbitrary and discriminatory application. They also asserted that the rules violated the First Amendment by compelling grantees to endorse the Administration\u2019s views on gender and chilling speech related to DEI. Finally, they argued that the restrictions conflicted with federal statutory mandates requiring services for \u201cunderserved\u201d and \u201cracial and ethnic minority\u201d populations and were adopted without complying with the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s procedural requirements.\n\nRepresented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought a declaration that the new conditions were unlawful, as well as an order vacating and setting them aside, along with the defendants\u2019 decision to include them in individual award programs. They also sought a stay of the conditions as applied in agency policies, funding opportunities, and grants, and requested preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the defendants from including or enforcing the conditions in any funding notices or awards.\n\nAlongside the complaint, plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order to block enforcement of the new conditions. They argued that immediate relief was necessary to prevent irreparable harm to the communities they serve, including the loss of housing and essential services. They reiterated that the conditions unlawfully compelled speech, threatened the stability of life-saving programs, and created confusion due to vague and unclear standards.\n\nA hearing on the motion for a temporary restraining order was held on July 24, 2025, and Judge DuBose granted the motion on July 28. 2025 WL 2104144. The court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed, at risk of immediate irreparable harm, and entitled to access their grant funding without the new HUD and HHS conditions after weighing the hardships and public interest. The temporary restraining order barred HUD from enforcing conditions related to gender ideology and elective abortions for Continuums of Care grants, and barred HHS and ACF from enforcing a condition requiring Family Violence Prevention and Services Act grant recipients to advance or promote DEI or related ideologies. The court declared these conditions null, void, and rescinded, and ordered defendants to take immediate compliance steps.\n\nOn August 4, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of the challenged conditions. They specifically targeted HUD policies that barred grantees from using funds to promote \u201cgender ideology,\u201d as defined in Executive Order 14168; prohibited the use of funds for elective abortions under Executive Order 14182; and required certification that DEI-related activities would not violate federal antidiscrimination laws. They also challenged HHS policies requiring grantees to certify that they do not operate programs promoting DEI or \u201cdiscriminatory equity ideology,\u201d and to affirm compliance with Executive Order 14168 as a condition of Title IX funding.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, Judge DuBose issued a revised TRO that clarified the scope of the earlier order and restated the specific prohibitions against HUD, HHS, and ACF in enforcing the challenged grant conditions. 2025 WL 2262896. Later that day, the court granted a third motion to amend the TRO, and the parties were instructed to appear for a virtual chambers conference on August 8. 2025 WL 2301661.\n\nA hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for September 4, 2025.",

    "target": "This case challenges federal agencies' imposition of alleged unlawful funding conditions on federal grants related to domestic violence, sexual assault, and homelessness services.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, several nonprofit organizations that receive federal grants to serve victims of domestic violence, victims of sexual assault, and homeless individuals filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary; the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and its Acting Assistant Secretary; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its Acting Director; the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) and its Administrator; and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and its Secretary. The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act, the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and were ultra vires. Judge Melissa R. DuBose presides over the case.\n\nPlaintiffs challenged funding restrictions imposed by the Trump Administration, including anti-Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEI/DEIA) requirements; \"Gender Ideology\" conditions, as defined in Executive Order 14168; and a \"HUD Abortion Condition\" that restricts the use of grant funds for elective abortions, following Executive Order 14182. Plaintiffs claimed these restrictions were ideologically motivated and designed to advance the Administration\u2019s agenda, rather than to further the statutory purposes of the underlying grant programs. They claimed the conditions were unlawful, arbitrary and capricious, and untethered to the authorizing statutes, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nPlaintiffs argued that these conditions placed them in an untenable position: either fundamentally alter their programming or lose essential federal funding\u2014jeopardizing critical services and displacing survivors from safe housing. They further contended that the executive branch unilaterally imposed these restrictions without congressional authorization, violating the separation of powers.\n\nIn addition, plaintiffs claimed the conditions were unconstitutionally vague, offering no clear guidance on prohibited conduct or enforcement standards, and thereby opening the door to arbitrary and discriminatory application. They also asserted that the rules violated the First Amendment by compelling grantees to endorse the Administration\u2019s views on gender and chilling speech related to DEI. Finally, they argued that the restrictions conflicted with federal statutory mandates requiring services for \u201cunderserved\u201d and \u201cracial and ethnic minority\u201d populations and were adopted without complying with the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s procedural requirements.\n\nRepresented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought a declaration that the new conditions were unlawful, as well as an order vacating and setting them aside, along with the defendants\u2019 decision to include them in individual award programs. They also sought a stay of the conditions as applied in agency policies, funding opportunities, and grants, and requested preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the defendants from including or enforcing the conditions in any funding notices or awards.\n\nAlongside the complaint, plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order to block enforcement of the new conditions. They argued that immediate relief was necessary to prevent irreparable harm to the communities they serve, including the loss of housing and essential services. They reiterated that the conditions unlawfully compelled speech, threatened the stability of life-saving programs, and created confusion due to vague and unclear standards.\n\nA hearing on the motion for a temporary restraining order was held on July 24, 2025, and Judge DuBose granted the motion on July 28. 2025 WL 2104144. The court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed, at risk of immediate irreparable harm, and entitled to access their grant funding without the new HUD and HHS conditions after weighing the hardships and public interest.

They also challenged HHS policies requiring grantees to certify that they do not operate programs promoting DEI or \u201cdiscriminatory equity ideology,\u201d and to affirm compliance with Executive Order 14168 as a condition of Title IX funding.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, Judge DuBose issued a revised TRO that clarified the scope of the earlier order and restated the specific prohibitions against HUD, HHS, and ACF in enforcing the challenged grant conditions. 2025 WL 2262896. Later that day, the court granted a third motion to amend the TRO, and the parties were instructed to appear for a virtual chambers conference on August 8. 2025 WL 2301661.\n\nA hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for September 4, 2025.",

The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act, the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and were ultra vires. Judge Melissa R.

The temporary restraining order barred HUD from enforcing conditions related to gender ideology and elective abortions for Continuums of Care grants, and barred HHS and ACF from enforcing a condition requiring Family Violence Prevention and Services Act grant recipients to advance or promote DEI or related ideologies. The court declared these conditions null, void, and rescinded, and ordered defendants to take immediate compliance steps.\n\nOn August 4, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of the challenged conditions.
