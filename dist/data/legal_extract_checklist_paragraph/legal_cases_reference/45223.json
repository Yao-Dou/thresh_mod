Proceeding pro se (that is, representing themselves), the plaintiffs filed their lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, where it was assigned to District Judge Edward M. Chen.\n\nThe plaintiffs, each of whom has a disability, alleged that the City was forcing them from the encampment without offering accessible shelter and without giving sufficient notice. They brought the following claims under 42 USC \u00a7 1983:\n\n\u2022 Exposure to State-Created Danger under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article I of the California Constitution   \u2022 Unreasonable Search and Seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article I of the California Constitution   \u2022 Infliction of Cruel and Unusual Punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. They also moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) the same day they filed their complaint. According to their motion for a TRO, the City of Berkeley had posted eviction notices three days earlier (on December 8th), warning that the encampment would be cleared on Tuesday, December 12. Plaintiffs argued the notices were vague, failed to identify adequate shelter options, and disproportionately harmed disabled residents.\n\nThe court granted the TRO on December 15, 2023. Filling in for Judge Chen on an emergency basis, District Judge Araceli Mart\u00ednez-Olgu\u00edn found that the plaintiffs had demonstrated \u201cserious questions going to the merits\u201d of their claims, and that the balance of hardships tipped \u201csharply in [their] favor.\u201d The court emphasized that the plaintiffs faced immediate and irreparable harm if evicted in the middle of winter without appropriate shelter\u2014one plaintiff because of his visual impairment, mobility limitations, and reliance on a support animal; another plaintiff because of physical disabilities and a nervous condition that prevented her from using congregate shelters.\n\nThe court also rejected the City\u2019s argument that the case was moot, noting that although the City had partially cleared the encampment before receiving notice of the TRO, the plaintiffs had returned and the risk of eviction remained live. The order enjoined the City from conducting further enforcement or eviction actions at 8th and Harrison until a full hearing could be held.\n\nAt the subsequent hearing, the City offered to place one plaintiff in a private room at the Berkeley Inn (where he could keep his dog) and to place another plaintiff in a room at the Campus Motel, with agreed-upon accommodations including grab bars in the bathroom and storage space for recycling materials. In light of these offers, Judge Chen dissolved the TRO on December 22, 2023, but allowed it to remain in effect for each plaintiff until their respective placements became available and appropriately modified. 2023 WL 8879260.\n\nIn February 2024, the Berkeley City Manager\u2019s Office announced that all eviction efforts at 8th and Harrison would be suspended pending further direction from the court in a related case, Prado v.

They also moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) the same day they filed their complaint. According to their motion for a TRO, the City of Berkeley had posted eviction notices three days earlier (on December 8th), warning that the encampment would be cleared on Tuesday, December 12. Plaintiffs argued the notices were vague, failed to identify adequate shelter options, and disproportionately harmed disabled residents.\n\nThe court granted the TRO on December 15, 2023. Filling in for Judge Chen on an emergency basis, District Judge Araceli Mart\u00ednez-Olgu\u00edn found that the plaintiffs had demonstrated \u201cserious questions going to the merits\u201d of their claims, and that the balance of hardships tipped \u201csharply in [their] favor.\u201d The court emphasized that the plaintiffs faced immediate and irreparable harm if evicted in the middle of winter without appropriate shelter\u2014one plaintiff because of his visual impairment, mobility limitations, and reliance on a support animal; another plaintiff because of physical disabilities and a nervous condition that prevented her from using congregate shelters.\n\nThe court also rejected the City\u2019s argument that the case was moot, noting that although the City had partially cleared the encampment before receiving notice of the TRO, the plaintiffs had returned and the risk of eviction remained live. The order enjoined the City from conducting further enforcement or eviction actions at 8th and Harrison until a full hearing could be held.\n\nAt the subsequent hearing, the City offered to place one plaintiff in a private room at the Berkeley Inn (where he could keep his dog) and to place another plaintiff in a room at the Campus Motel, with agreed-upon accommodations including grab bars in the bathroom and storage space for recycling materials. In light of these offers, Judge Chen dissolved the TRO on December 22, 2023, but allowed it to remain in effect for each plaintiff until their respective placements became available and appropriately modified. 2023 WL 8879260.\n\nIn February 2024, the Berkeley City Manager\u2019s Office announced that all eviction efforts at 8th and Harrison would be suspended pending further direction from the court in a related case, Prado v. City of Berkeley [../../../../case/46634/].

    "target": "This case arose from a city\u2019s plan to imminently clear an encampment of unhoused individuals with little notice.\n\nOn December 11, 2023, three unhoused individuals filed suit against the City of Berkeley to prevent their eviction from an encampment at 8th and Harrison Streets. Proceeding pro se (that is, representing themselves), the plaintiffs filed their lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, where it was assigned to District Judge Edward M. Chen.\n\nThe plaintiffs, each of whom has a disability, alleged that the City was forcing them from the encampment without offering accessible shelter and without giving sufficient notice. They brought the following claims under 42 USC \u00a7 1983:\n\n\u2022 Exposure to State-Created Danger under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article I of the California Constitution   \u2022 Unreasonable Search and Seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article I of the California Constitution   \u2022 Infliction of Cruel and Unusual Punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.
