(To see the Clearinghouse's collection of legal challenges to actions by the second Trump Administration, click here [../../../../collections/38759].)\n\nPrior to this lawsuit, President Trump said he wanted to use Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s 30,000 beds \u201cto detain the worst criminal illegal aliens threatening the American people\u201d (reported here [https://www.npr.org/2025/01/30/g-s1-45454/trump-says-u-s-will-send-worst-criminal-illegal-aliens-to-guantanamo-bay]), and on January 29, 2025, he issued a memorandum [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/expanding-migrant-operations-center-at-naval-station-guantanamo-bay-to-full-capacity/] to expand the Migrant Operations Center there. After migrants were sent to Guant\u00e1namo, a lawsuit directed at ensuring access to counsel for people detained there was filed on February 12, 2025. See Las Americas Immigr. Advoc. Ctr. v. Noem, No. 25-cv-418 (D.D.C. filed Feb. 12, 2025) (\u201cLas Americas\u201d) and the Clearinghouse's summary here [../../../../case/46109/].\n\nThen on March 1, 2025, this lawsuit was filed by ten noncitizens in immigration custody who were at imminent risk of transfer from the U.S. to Guant\u00e1namo. They were represented by the ACLU, ACLU of DC, International Refugee Assistance Project, and Center for Constitutional Rights. They sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Department of Defense, and the heads of each agency in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged that the transfers and detention at Guant\u00e1namo violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and\u2014because the transfers are undertaken for punitive, illegitimate reasons and the conditions in which the detainees are housed are unconstitutional\u2014the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. They sought a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, a writ of habeas corpus, and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. The case was assigned to District Judge Carl J. Nichols, who already had Las Americas before him.\n\nSimultaneously with the complaint, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion seeking to halt the transfers. This motion was denied during a hearing on March 14, 2025 (reported here [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/judge-guantanamo-detention-migrants.html]).\n\nOn March 29, 2025, one of the plaintiffs (Mr. Espinoza Escalona) was transferred from the U.S. to Guant\u00e1namo, then the next day, they were transferred to El Salvador. Per the plaintiff's counsel, they did not receive any notice from the government of his transfer until approximately four days after his transport to Guant\u00e1namo. As such, they argued they had no opportunity to timely intervene during his detention at Guant\u00e1namo\u2014the entire purpose of the court's notice requirement\u2014and requested a court order that the defendants provide 24-hour advance notice prior to the transfer of any of the remaining plaintiffs to Guant\u00e1namo.\n\nOn May 19, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for mootness, lack of standing, lack of jurisdiction, failure to state a claim, improper venue, and failure to allege a substantive Due Process claim. The following week, on May 22, 2025, plaintiffs gave notice of voluntary dismissal on all charges and against all parties, stating that certain members of the plaintiffs had been deported by the defendants, rendering their claims moot, and that the remaining plaintiffs no longer wished to continue the litigation.\n\nThis case is dismissed.",

(To see the Clearinghouse's collection of legal challenges to actions by the second Trump Administration, click here [../../../../collections/38759].)\n\nPrior to this lawsuit, President Trump said he wanted to use Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s 30,000 beds \u201cto detain the worst criminal illegal aliens threatening the American people\u201d (reported here [https://www.npr.org/2025/01/30/g-s1-45454/trump-says-u-s-will-send-worst-criminal-illegal-aliens-to-guantanamo-bay]), and on January 29, 2025, he issued a memorandum [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/expanding-migrant-operations-center-at-naval-station-guantanamo-bay-to-full-capacity/] to expand the Migrant Operations Center there. After migrants were sent to Guant\u00e1namo, a lawsuit directed at ensuring access to counsel for people detained there was filed on February 12, 2025. See Las Americas Immigr. Advoc. Ctr. v. Noem, No. 25-cv-418 (D.D.C. filed Feb. 12, 2025) (\u201cLas Americas\u201d) and the Clearinghouse's summary here [../../../../case/46109/].\n\nThen on March 1, 2025, this lawsuit was filed by ten noncitizens in immigration custody who were at imminent risk of transfer from the U.S. to Guant\u00e1namo. They were represented by the ACLU, ACLU of DC, International Refugee Assistance Project, and Center for Constitutional Rights. They sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Department of Defense, and the heads of each agency in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged that the transfers and detention at Guant\u00e1namo violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and\u2014because the transfers are undertaken for punitive, illegitimate reasons and the conditions in which the detainees are housed are unconstitutional\u2014the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. They sought a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, a writ of habeas corpus, and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. The case was assigned to District Judge Carl J. Nichols, who already had Las Americas before him.\n\nSimultaneously with the complaint, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion seeking to halt the transfers. This motion was denied during a hearing on March 14, 2025 (reported here [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/judge-guantanamo-detention-migrants.html]).\n\nOn March 29, 2025, one of the plaintiffs (Mr. Espinoza Escalona) was transferred from the U.S. to Guant\u00e1namo, then the next day, they were transferred to El Salvador. Per the plaintiff's counsel, they did not receive any notice from the government of his transfer until approximately four days after his transport to Guant\u00e1namo. As such, they argued they had no opportunity to timely intervene during his detention at Guant\u00e1namo\u2014the entire purpose of the court's notice requirement\u2014and requested a court order that the defendants provide 24-hour advance notice prior to the transfer of any of the remaining plaintiffs to Guant\u00e1namo.\n\nOn May 19, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for mootness, lack of standing, lack of jurisdiction, failure to state a claim, improper venue, and failure to allege a substantive Due Process claim. The following week, on May 22, 2025, plaintiffs gave notice of voluntary dismissal on all charges and against all parties, stating that certain members of the plaintiffs had been deported by the defendants, rendering their claims moot, and that the remaining plaintiffs no longer wished to continue the litigation.\n\nThis case is dismissed.",

(To see the Clearinghouse's collection of legal challenges to actions by the second Trump Administration, click here [../../../../collections/38759].)\n\nPrior to this lawsuit, President Trump said he wanted to use Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s 30,000 beds \u201cto detain the worst criminal illegal aliens threatening the American people\u201d (reported here [https://www.npr.org/2025/01/30/g-s1-45454/trump-says-u-s-will-send-worst-criminal-illegal-aliens-to-guantanamo-bay]), and on January 29, 2025, he issued a memorandum [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/expanding-migrant-operations-center-at-naval-station-guantanamo-bay-to-full-capacity/] to expand the Migrant Operations Center there. After migrants were sent to Guant\u00e1namo, a lawsuit directed at ensuring access to counsel for people detained there was filed on February 12, 2025. See Las Americas Immigr. Advoc. Ctr. v.

They were represented by the ACLU, ACLU of DC, International Refugee Assistance Project, and Center for Constitutional Rights. They sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Department of Defense, and the heads of each agency in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
