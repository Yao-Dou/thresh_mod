    "target": "On February 10, 2020, fourteen prisoners at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman, Mississippi, filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi. Press reports [https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/14/us/jay-z-yo-gotti-mississippi-prisons-lawsuit-trnd/index.html] connected this sue to entertainment mogul Jay-Z, who had the month before written an open letter to Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant decrying the conditions at state correctional facilities. The plaintiffs claimed that state officials were aware of and deliberately indifferent to inhumane conditions, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that Parchman\u2019s chronic understaffing and overcrowding, frequent outbreaks of violence, and physical neglect to the facilities violated the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe plaintiffs sued the Commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Corrections and the Superintendent of the Mississippi Penitentiary under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages.\u00a0The plaintiffs outlined how Parchman\u2019s frequent outbreaks of violence culminated in eight deaths in the first month of 2020. The understaffing and overcrowding at Parchman led to severe failure to provide adequate living conditions, including exposure to raw sewage and extreme temperatures, denial of urgent medical care, and food and water unfit for human consumption. The case was assigned to District Judge Debra Brown.\n\nOn March 2, 2021, Judge Brown dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for failure to provide adequate notice to the defendants of the claims against them. The plaintiffs filed their fifth amended complaint on March 16, 2021, resolving these issues.\n\nThe defendant moved to dismiss the amended complaint less than two weeks later on March 30, 2021, raising qualified immunity and asserting that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim or to allege physical injuries, as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act.\n\nOn November 2, 2021, Judge Brown dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for compensatory damages to the extent that the claims were based on mental or emotional, rather than physical, injuries. \u00a0The court also dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) that the defendants conspired to deprive plaintiffs of equal protection because the allegations failed to allege that racial animus motivated the conspiracy.\u00a0\u00a0In the same order, however, the court denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the basis of qualified immunity, finding that the plaintiffs pleaded facts that, if proven, would amount to violation of clearly established constitutional rights.\n\nOn December 28, 2021, Judge Brown (who had become chief judge) reassigned the matter to Judge Sharion Aycock.\n\nDiscovery proceeded with several interruptions over the next several years with parties scheduling depositions and filing motions with respect to expert testimony. On March 4, 2022, defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs' fifth amended complaint. The motion was granted in part on March 22, dismissing the claims against Marshal Turner, superintendent of Parchman, but preserving all other claims.\n\nOn February 9, 2024, plaintiffs moved to certify their class. On September 23, 2024, Judge Aycock rejected certification of the class on the basis that the plaintiffs failed to establish that the putative class members\u2019 claims each depended upon a common issue such that its resolution would resolve the claims of all members of the class. \u00a0The order note that resolving claims challenged by qualified immunity required proof that each Defendant was aware of each specific allegedly unconstitutional condition that each Plaintiff faced and failed to respond as a reasonable officer would have done under the circumstances. The order also noted the length of the class period and the variations in violations raised by different plaintiffs.\n\nOn October 23, 2024, defendants moved to sever the plaintiffs' claims into separate civil actions, capitalizing on the court's opinion denying class certification in arguing that severing the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims into separate actions, or at least holding separate trials, would help the court to avoid prejudice and delay and ensure fairness of proceedings.\n\nOn November 13, 2024, the court held that the appropriate resolution was for each individual plaintiff to file their own lawsuit. \u00a0The court ordered the plaintiffs to limit their separate lawsuits to the claims raised in this lawsuit and to tailor each case to each respective plaintiff. \u00a0The parties expected to complete remaining discovery in the new cases.\n\nOn January 6, 2025, Justice Aycock dismissed plaintiffs' claims without prejudice. This case is now closed.",

    "target": "On February 10, 2020, fourteen prisoners at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman, Mississippi, filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi. Press reports [https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/14/us/jay-z-yo-gotti-mississippi-prisons-lawsuit-trnd/index.html] connected this sue to entertainment mogul Jay-Z, who had the month before written an open letter to Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant decrying the conditions at state correctional facilities. The plaintiffs claimed that state officials were aware of and deliberately indifferent to inhumane conditions, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that Parchman\u2019s chronic understaffing and overcrowding, frequent outbreaks of violence, and physical neglect to the facilities violated the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe plaintiffs sued the Commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Corrections and the Superintendent of the Mississippi Penitentiary under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages.\u00a0The plaintiffs outlined how Parchman\u2019s frequent outbreaks of violence culminated in eight deaths in the first month of 2020. The understaffing and overcrowding at Parchman led to severe failure to provide adequate living conditions, including exposure to raw sewage and extreme temperatures, denial of urgent medical care, and food and water unfit for human consumption. The case was assigned to District Judge Debra Brown.\n\nOn March 2, 2021, Judge Brown dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for failure to provide adequate notice to the defendants of the claims against them. The plaintiffs filed their fifth amended complaint on March 16, 2021, resolving these issues.\n\nThe defendant moved to dismiss the amended complaint less than two weeks later on March 30, 2021, raising qualified immunity and asserting that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim or to allege physical injuries, as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act.\n\nOn November 2, 2021, Judge Brown dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for compensatory damages to the extent that the claims were based on mental or emotional, rather than physical, injuries. \u00a0The court also dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) that the defendants conspired to deprive plaintiffs of equal protection because the allegations failed to allege that racial animus motivated the conspiracy.\u00a0\u00a0In the same order, however, the court denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the basis of qualified immunity, finding that the plaintiffs pleaded facts that, if proven, would amount to violation of clearly established constitutional rights.\n\nOn December 28, 2021, Judge Brown (who had become chief judge) reassigned the matter to Judge Sharion Aycock.\n\nDiscovery proceeded with several interruptions over the next several years with parties scheduling depositions and filing motions with respect to expert testimony. On March 4, 2022, defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs' fifth amended complaint. The motion was granted in part on March 22, dismissing the claims against Marshal Turner, superintendent of Parchman, but preserving all other claims.\n\nOn February 9, 2024, plaintiffs moved to certify their class. On September 23, 2024, Judge Aycock rejected certification of the class on the basis that the plaintiffs failed to establish that the putative class members\u2019 claims each depended upon a common issue such that its resolution would resolve the claims of all members of the class. \u00a0The order note that resolving claims challenged by qualified immunity required proof that each Defendant was aware of each specific allegedly unconstitutional condition that each Plaintiff faced and failed to respond as a reasonable officer would have done under the circumstances. The order also noted the length of the class period and the variations in violations raised by different plaintiffs.\n\nOn October 23, 2024, defendants moved to sever the plaintiffs' claims into separate civil actions, capitalizing on the court's opinion denying class certification in arguing that severing the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims into separate actions, or at least holding separate trials, would help the court to avoid prejudice and delay and ensure fairness of proceedings.\n\nOn November 13, 2024, the court held that the appropriate resolution was for each individual plaintiff to file their own lawsuit. \u00a0The court ordered the plaintiffs to limit their separate lawsuits to the claims raised in this lawsuit and to tailor each case to each respective plaintiff. \u00a0The parties expected to complete remaining discovery in the new cases.\n\nOn January 6, 2025, Justice Aycock dismissed plaintiffs' claims without prejudice. This case is now closed.",
