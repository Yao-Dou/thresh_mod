    "target": "This case challenged mass terminations and office shutdowns at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). On May 5, 2025, nineteen states and the District of Columbia filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and numerous related federal agencies and their agency heads. The states challenged layoffs that took place due to a March 27, 2025, directive that ordered a reduction in force of about 10,000 full-time employees. The directive also ordered the restructuring of HHS, shrinking the previous twenty-eight divisions down to fifteen. The layoffs took place on April 1.\n\nRepresented by their attorneys general, the states alleged that the dismantling of HHS left it incapable of performing its statutory functions in violation of the Separation of Powers, the Appropriations Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The states also alleged that the defendants' actions were ultra vires in excess of their statutory authority. The states requested a declaration that the layoffs were unlawful, injunctive relief preventing the defendants from implementing the March 27 directive, and court costs.\n\nOn May 9, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Melissa R. DuBose, who held a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary relief on May 22 and issued a preliminary injunction on July 1, 2025. 2025 WL 1803260. The court held that the states had standing to bring the lawsuit, that the claims were not subject to channeling pursuant to the Civil Service Reform Act, that the Tucker Act did not require the states to bring their claims in the Court of Federal Claims, that the March 27 directive constituted a final agency action subject to review under the APA, and that the states had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims that the challenged actions were arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law, had shown irreparable harm absent relief, and that the balance of equities and public interest weighed in their favor.\u00a0 Accordingly, the court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from \"taking any actions to implement or enforce the planned RIFs or sub-agency restructuring announced\" in the directive. Finally, the court also \"preemptively\" denied the defendants' request for a stay pending any appeal they might decide to file.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, the defendants moved to clarify the preliminary injunction and also argued that the injunction was overbroad given the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Casa Inc. v. Trump [../../../../case/45965/], which held that federal courts lacked the power to grant relief to parties outside of those involved in the case before them. On July 17, 2025, the defendants also filed a motion to vacate the preliminary injunction, or in the alternative, to stay it pending appeal. The defendants pointed to the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in New York v. McMahon [../../../../case/46217/], which allowed the government to proceed with a reduction-in-force at the Department of Education while litigation over the RIF continued. The defendants argued that \"[b]ecause the facts and legal issues in [McMahon]\u00a0are so similar to those presented here, the stays signal that a majority of the Supreme Court would likely reach the same conclusion if asked to consider this case.\" Therefore, the defendants asked the court to vacate its preliminary injunction or to stay it while they appealed.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the court denied all the defendants' motions except the motion to clarify, announcing that \"without any actual changes to governing case law or binding First Circuit or Supreme Court precedent, this Court declines the Defendants\u2019 invitation to short circuit that process.\" Rejecting the defendants' claims that the Supreme Court's stay in McMahon\u00a0meant that the district court should vacate its preliminary injunction, the court stated that it \"w[ould] not interpret the Supreme Court\u2019s shadow docket summary orders (issued without any reasoning or explanation) as definitive indications as to how either the Supreme Court or the First Circuit Court of Appeals might rule on a motion to stay or on the merits of this case.\"\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the court granted in part the defendants' motion to clarify the preliminary injunction and issued a revised injunction that named the specific sub-agencies and programs subject to the order. The next day, the defendants filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (USCA Case No. 25-1780) as well as an emergency motion in the appellate court to stay the injunction pending appeal.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged mass terminations and office shutdowns at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). On May 5, 2025, nineteen states and the District of Columbia filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and numerous related federal agencies and their agency heads. The states challenged layoffs that took place due to a March 27, 2025, directive that ordered a reduction in force of about 10,000 full-time employees. The directive also ordered the restructuring of HHS, shrinking the previous twenty-eight divisions down to fifteen. The layoffs took place on April 1.\n\nRepresented by their attorneys general, the states alleged that the dismantling of HHS left it incapable of performing its statutory functions in violation of the Separation of Powers, the Appropriations Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The states also alleged that the defendants' actions were ultra vires in excess of their statutory authority. The states requested a declaration that the layoffs were unlawful, injunctive relief preventing the defendants from implementing the March 27 directive, and court costs.\n\nOn May 9, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Melissa R. DuBose, who held a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary relief on May 22 and issued a preliminary injunction on July 1, 2025. 2025 WL 1803260. The court held that the states had standing to bring the lawsuit, that the claims were not subject to channeling pursuant to the Civil Service Reform Act, that the Tucker Act did not require the states to bring their claims in the Court of Federal Claims, that the March 27 directive constituted a final agency action subject to review under the APA, and that the states had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims that the challenged actions were arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law, had shown irreparable harm absent relief, and that the balance of equities and public interest weighed in their favor.\u00a0 Accordingly, the court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from \"taking any actions to implement or enforce the planned RIFs or sub-agency restructuring announced\" in the directive. Finally, the court also \"preemptively\" denied the defendants' request for a stay pending any appeal they might decide to file.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, the defendants moved to clarify the preliminary injunction and also argued that the injunction was overbroad given the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Casa Inc. v. Trump [../../../../case/45965/], which held that federal courts lacked the power to grant relief to parties outside of those involved in the case before them. On July 17, 2025, the defendants also filed a motion to vacate the preliminary injunction, or in the alternative, to stay it pending appeal. The defendants pointed to the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in New York v. McMahon [../../../../case/46217/], which allowed the government to proceed with a reduction-in-force at the Department of Education while litigation over the RIF continued. The defendants argued that \"[b]ecause the facts and legal issues in [McMahon]\u00a0are so similar to those presented here, the stays signal that a majority of the Supreme Court would likely reach the same conclusion if asked to consider this case.\" Therefore, the defendants asked the court to vacate its preliminary injunction or to stay it while they appealed.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the court denied all the defendants' motions except the motion to clarify, announcing that \"without any actual changes to governing case law or binding First Circuit or Supreme Court precedent, this Court declines the Defendants\u2019 invitation to short circuit that process.\" Rejecting the defendants' claims that the Supreme Court's stay in McMahon\u00a0meant that the district court should vacate its preliminary injunction, the court stated that it \"w[ould] not interpret the Supreme Court\u2019s shadow docket summary orders (issued without any reasoning or explanation) as definitive indications as to how either the Supreme Court or the First Circuit Court of Appeals might rule on a motion to stay or on the merits of this case.\"\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the court granted in part the defendants' motion to clarify the preliminary injunction and issued a revised injunction that named the specific sub-agencies and programs subject to the order. The next day, the defendants filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (USCA Case No. 25-1780) as well as an emergency motion in the appellate court to stay the injunction pending appeal.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged mass terminations and office shutdowns at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). On May 5, 2025, nineteen states and the District of Columbia filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and numerous related federal agencies and their agency heads. The states challenged layoffs that took place due to a March 27, 2025, directive that ordered a reduction in force of about 10,000 full-time employees. The directive also ordered the restructuring of HHS, shrinking the previous twenty-eight divisions down to fifteen. The layoffs took place on April 1.\n\nRepresented by their attorneys general, the states alleged that the dismantling of HHS left it incapable of performing its statutory functions in violation of the Separation of Powers, the Appropriations Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The states also alleged that the defendants' actions were ultra vires in excess of their statutory authority. The states requested a declaration that the layoffs were unlawful, injunctive relief preventing the defendants from implementing the March 27 directive, and court costs.\n\nOn May 9, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Melissa R. DuBose, who held a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary relief on May 22 and issued a preliminary injunction on July 1, 2025. 2025 WL 1803260. The court held that the states had standing to bring the lawsuit, that the claims were not subject to channeling pursuant to the Civil Service Reform Act, that the Tucker Act did not require the states to bring their claims in the Court of Federal Claims, that the March 27 directive constituted a final agency action subject to review under the APA, and that the states had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims that the challenged actions were arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law, had shown irreparable harm absent relief, and that the balance of equities and public interest weighed in their favor.\u00a0 Accordingly, the court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from \"taking any actions to implement or enforce the planned RIFs or sub-agency restructuring announced\" in the directive. Finally, the court also \"preemptively\" denied the defendants' request for a stay pending any appeal they might decide to file.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, the defendants moved to clarify the preliminary injunction and also argued that the injunction was overbroad given the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Casa Inc. v. Trump [../../../../case/45965/], which held that federal courts lacked the power to grant relief to parties outside of those involved in the case before them. On July 17, 2025, the defendants also filed a motion to vacate the preliminary injunction, or in the alternative, to stay it pending appeal. The defendants pointed to the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in New York v. McMahon [../../../../case/46217/], which allowed the government to proceed with a reduction-in-force at the Department of Education while litigation over the RIF continued. The defendants argued that \"[b]ecause the facts and legal issues in [McMahon]\u00a0are so similar to those presented here, the stays signal that a majority of the Supreme Court would likely reach the same conclusion if asked to consider this case.\" Therefore, the defendants asked the court to vacate its preliminary injunction or to stay it while they appealed.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the court denied all the defendants' motions except the motion to clarify, announcing that \"without any actual changes to governing case law or binding First Circuit or Supreme Court precedent, this Court declines the Defendants\u2019 invitation to short circuit that process.\" Rejecting the defendants' claims that the Supreme Court's stay in McMahon\u00a0meant that the district court should vacate its preliminary injunction, the court stated that it \"w[ould] not interpret the Supreme Court\u2019s shadow docket summary orders (issued without any reasoning or explanation) as definitive indications as to how either the Supreme Court or the First Circuit Court of Appeals might rule on a motion to stay or on the merits of this case.\"\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the court granted in part the defendants' motion to clarify the preliminary injunction and issued a revised injunction that named the specific sub-agencies and programs subject to the order. The next day, the defendants filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (USCA Case No. 25-1780) as well as an emergency motion in the appellate court to stay the injunction pending appeal.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged mass terminations and office shutdowns at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). On May 5, 2025, nineteen states and the District of Columbia filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and numerous related federal agencies and their agency heads. The states challenged layoffs that took place due to a March 27, 2025, directive that ordered a reduction in force of about 10,000 full-time employees. The directive also ordered the restructuring of HHS, shrinking the previous twenty-eight divisions down to fifteen. The layoffs took place on April 1.\n\nRepresented by their attorneys general, the states alleged that the dismantling of HHS left it incapable of performing its statutory functions in violation of the Separation of Powers, the Appropriations Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The states also alleged that the defendants' actions were ultra vires in excess of their statutory authority. The states requested a declaration that the layoffs were unlawful, injunctive relief preventing the defendants from implementing the March 27 directive, and court costs.\n\nOn May 9, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Melissa R. DuBose, who held a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary relief on May 22 and issued a preliminary injunction on July 1, 2025. 2025 WL 1803260. The court held that the states had standing to bring the lawsuit, that the claims were not subject to channeling pursuant to the Civil Service Reform Act, that the Tucker Act did not require the states to bring their claims in the Court of Federal Claims, that the March 27 directive constituted a final agency action subject to review under the APA, and that the states had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims that the challenged actions were arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law, had shown irreparable harm absent relief, and that the balance of equities and public interest weighed in their favor.\u00a0 Accordingly, the court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from \"taking any actions to implement or enforce the planned RIFs or sub-agency restructuring announced\" in the directive. Finally, the court also \"preemptively\" denied the defendants' request for a stay pending any appeal they might decide to file.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, the defendants moved to clarify the preliminary injunction and also argued that the injunction was overbroad given the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Casa Inc. v. Trump [../../../../case/45965/], which held that federal courts lacked the power to grant relief to parties outside of those involved in the case before them. On July 17, 2025, the defendants also filed a motion to vacate the preliminary injunction, or in the alternative, to stay it pending appeal. The defendants pointed to the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in New York v. McMahon [../../../../case/46217/], which allowed the government to proceed with a reduction-in-force at the Department of Education while litigation over the RIF continued. The defendants argued that \"[b]ecause the facts and legal issues in [McMahon]\u00a0are so similar to those presented here, the stays signal that a majority of the Supreme Court would likely reach the same conclusion if asked to consider this case.\" Therefore, the defendants asked the court to vacate its preliminary injunction or to stay it while they appealed.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the court denied all the defendants' motions except the motion to clarify, announcing that \"without any actual changes to governing case law or binding First Circuit or Supreme Court precedent, this Court declines the Defendants\u2019 invitation to short circuit that process.\" Rejecting the defendants' claims that the Supreme Court's stay in McMahon\u00a0meant that the district court should vacate its preliminary injunction, the court stated that it \"w[ould] not interpret the Supreme Court\u2019s shadow docket summary orders (issued without any reasoning or explanation) as definitive indications as to how either the Supreme Court or the First Circuit Court of Appeals might rule on a motion to stay or on the merits of this case.\"\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the court granted in part the defendants' motion to clarify the preliminary injunction and issued a revised injunction that named the specific sub-agencies and programs subject to the order. The next day, the defendants filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (USCA Case No. 25-1780) as well as an emergency motion in the appellate court to stay the injunction pending appeal.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",
