    "target": "In this case challenging the constitutionality of a 1976 federal statute that prohibits the Military Health System from providing coverage for medically necessary surgical treatments for gender dysphoria for dependents of service members, a federal district court judge held that the prohibition violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nOn December 1, 2022, a \u200btransgender woman receiving health insurance through the U.S. military's TRICARE program as a dependent of a former servicemember and her father, a former servicemember, filed the case in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine. The plaintiffs sued the Secretary of Defense, the U.S. Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d), its component agency U.S. Defense Health Agency, and TRICARE Health Plan (\u201cTricare\u201d), the U.S. military\u2019s healthcare program administered through the DoD. \u200bThe Plaintiffs challenged a TRICARE provision that bars coverage of any surgery that \u201cimproves physical appearance\u201d without \u201csignificantly restor[ing] functions,\u201d including \u201csex gender changes.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1079(a)(11). The plaintiffs contended that this exclusion barred the former service member\u2019s daughter from receiving necessary procedures to treat her diagnosed gender dysphoria. They alleged the Defendants\u2019 enforcement of this provision to deny coverage of medically necessary gender transition surgeries violated the Plaintiffs\u2019 Equal Protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\nPlaintiffs, represented by GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) and private counsel, brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1079 (a)(11) (\u201cSection 1079\u201d), which mandates the categorical exclusion of all surgical treatments for gender transition in the military\u2019s medical coverage for eligible dependents of service members, violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs also alleged that TRICARE\u2019s refusal to cover surgical treatments for gender transition for eligible dependents of service members, including by the application and enforcement of the exclusion in Section 1079, violated the federal Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. Plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment, permanent injunctive relief to prevent the enforcement of the statutory exclusion, damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on January 27, 2023, in which they added an additional plaintiff, another transgender woman and dependent of a former service member who had been denied healthcare coverage by TRICARE for surgical procedures necessary to treat her gender dysphoria.\n\nOn December 1, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and a stipulation of voluntary dismissal, in which they dismissed with prejudice their Due Process and Rehabilitation Act claims, and withdrew their damage claims. The DoD filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on February 16, 2024, and both parties completed their briefing on the cross-motions for summary judgment by April 5, 2024.\n\nOn November 1, 2024, District Judge Nancy Torresen granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on their as-applied Equal Protection claim, finding that the TRICARE statutory exclusion discriminated based on sex and transgender status. The court relied on well-established precedents which instruct that sex- and gender-based classifications invoke intermediate scrutiny, and on Bostock v. Clayton County [../../../../case/17313], 590 U.S. 644, 669 (2020) to apply intermediate scrutiny to claims of gender-identity discrimination. Applying intermediate scrutiny, the court found that the DoD failed to identify any important governmental objective to justify the exclusion and raised only technical and procedural objections to the plaintiffs\u2019 Equal Protection claims; accordingly, the court granted partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs as to their as-applied Equal Protection claim. However, the court granted partial summary judgment to the DoD as to the plaintiffs' facial Equal Protection claim, finding that the statute could be interpreted in a constitutional manner. The court issued a declaratory judgment stating that the statutory exclusion was unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiffs, and ordered the parties to meet and confer by November 15, 2024 to determine whether injunctive relief was necessary.\n\nFollowing the Court\u2019s order to meet and confer, the parties filed a joint order on November 15, 2024, stating that they have conferred and jointly believed that all remaining issues in the case could be resolved through settlement without the need for further Court intervention, and that no injunctive relief was necessary at the time of the filing. The parties also requested that the Court defer entering a judgment while settlement negotiations were ongoing.\n\nOn December 13, 2024, the House of Representatives filed a Motion to Intervene and stated its intent to appeal the Court\u2019s decision on the cross-motions for summary judgment once the Court entered judgment in this case. Specifically, the House of Representatives noted its intent to appeal the Court\u2019s determination that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause as applied to the plaintiffs and to defend the constitutionality of the statute, claiming that the Department of Justice had failed to substantively defend the statute\u2019s constitutionality and noting that the DOJ appeared unlikely to contest the Court\u2019s decision.\n\nIn a December 16, 2024 Joint Status Report, the parties reiterated their belief that the case should be resolved via a settlement agreement and expressed their mutual opposition to the House of Representatives\u2019 motion to intervene. On December 20, 2024, the parties voluntarily dismissed the case with prejudice and without attorneys\u2019 fees or costs to either party. Two days later, the House of Representatives filed a notice in the case, in which it claimed that its pending intervention motion was not moot following the stipulated dismissal of the case. On January 3, 2025, both parties to the case filed responses opposing the House of Representatives\u2019 intervention in the case; on January 8, 2025, the House withdrew its motion to intervene.\n\nGiven that the motion to intervene has been withdrawn and the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal of the case, this case is effectively closed.",

    "target": "In this case challenging the constitutionality of a 1976 federal statute that prohibits the Military Health System from providing coverage for medically necessary surgical treatments for gender dysphoria for dependents of service members, a federal district court judge held that the prohibition violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nOn December 1, 2022, a \u200btransgender woman receiving health insurance through the U.S. military's TRICARE program as a dependent of a former servicemember and her father, a former servicemember, filed the case in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine. The plaintiffs sued the Secretary of Defense, the U.S. Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d), its component agency U.S. Defense Health Agency, and TRICARE Health Plan (\u201cTricare\u201d), the U.S. military\u2019s healthcare program administered through the DoD. \u200bThe Plaintiffs challenged a TRICARE provision that bars coverage of any surgery that \u201cimproves physical appearance\u201d without \u201csignificantly restor[ing] functions,\u201d including \u201csex gender changes.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1079(a)(11). The plaintiffs contended that this exclusion barred the former service member\u2019s daughter from receiving necessary procedures to treat her diagnosed gender dysphoria. They alleged the Defendants\u2019 enforcement of this provision to deny coverage of medically necessary gender transition surgeries violated the Plaintiffs\u2019 Equal Protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\nPlaintiffs, represented by GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) and private counsel, brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1079 (a)(11) (\u201cSection 1079\u201d), which mandates the categorical exclusion of all surgical treatments for gender transition in the military\u2019s medical coverage for eligible dependents of service members, violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs also alleged that TRICARE\u2019s refusal to cover surgical treatments for gender transition for eligible dependents of service members, including by the application and enforcement of the exclusion in Section 1079, violated the federal Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. Plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment, permanent injunctive relief to prevent the enforcement of the statutory exclusion, damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on January 27, 2023, in which they added an additional plaintiff, another transgender woman and dependent of a former service member who had been denied healthcare coverage by TRICARE for surgical procedures necessary to treat her gender dysphoria.\n\nOn December 1, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and a stipulation of voluntary dismissal, in which they dismissed with prejudice their Due Process and Rehabilitation Act claims, and withdrew their damage claims. The DoD filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on February 16, 2024, and both parties completed their briefing on the cross-motions for summary judgment by April 5, 2024.\n\nOn November 1, 2024, District Judge Nancy Torresen granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on their as-applied Equal Protection claim, finding that the TRICARE statutory exclusion discriminated based on sex and transgender status. The court relied on well-established precedents which instruct that sex- and gender-based classifications invoke intermediate scrutiny, and on Bostock v. Clayton County [../../../../case/17313], 590 U.S. 644, 669 (2020) to apply intermediate scrutiny to claims of gender-identity discrimination. Applying intermediate scrutiny, the court found that the DoD failed to identify any important governmental objective to justify the exclusion and raised only technical and procedural objections to the plaintiffs\u2019 Equal Protection claims; accordingly, the court granted partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs as to their as-applied Equal Protection claim. However, the court granted partial summary judgment to the DoD as to the plaintiffs' facial Equal Protection claim, finding that the statute could be interpreted in a constitutional manner. The court issued a declaratory judgment stating that the statutory exclusion was unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiffs, and ordered the parties to meet and confer by November 15, 2024 to determine whether injunctive relief was necessary.\n\nFollowing the Court\u2019s order to meet and confer, the parties filed a joint order on November 15, 2024, stating that they have conferred and jointly believed that all remaining issues in the case could be resolved through settlement without the need for further Court intervention, and that no injunctive relief was necessary at the time of the filing. The parties also requested that the Court defer entering a judgment while settlement negotiations were ongoing.\n\nOn December 13, 2024, the House of Representatives filed a Motion to Intervene and stated its intent to appeal the Court\u2019s decision on the cross-motions for summary judgment once the Court entered judgment in this case. Specifically, the House of Representatives noted its intent to appeal the Court\u2019s determination that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause as applied to the plaintiffs and to defend the constitutionality of the statute, claiming that the Department of Justice had failed to substantively defend the statute\u2019s constitutionality and noting that the DOJ appeared unlikely to contest the Court\u2019s decision.\n\nIn a December 16, 2024 Joint Status Report, the parties reiterated their belief that the case should be resolved via a settlement agreement and expressed their mutual opposition to the House of Representatives\u2019 motion to intervene. On December 20, 2024, the parties voluntarily dismissed the case with prejudice and without attorneys\u2019 fees or costs to either party. Two days later, the House of Representatives filed a notice in the case, in which it claimed that its pending intervention motion was not moot following the stipulated dismissal of the case. On January 3, 2025, both parties to the case filed responses opposing the House of Representatives\u2019 intervention in the case; on January 8, 2025, the House withdrew its motion to intervene.\n\nGiven that the motion to intervene has been withdrawn and the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal of the case, this case is effectively closed.",

    "target": "In this case challenging the constitutionality of a 1976 federal statute that prohibits the Military Health System from providing coverage for medically necessary surgical treatments for gender dysphoria for dependents of service members, a federal district court judge held that the prohibition violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nOn December 1, 2022, a \u200btransgender woman receiving health insurance through the U.S. military's TRICARE program as a dependent of a former servicemember and her father, a former servicemember, filed the case in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine. The plaintiffs sued the Secretary of Defense, the U.S. Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d), its component agency U.S. Defense Health Agency, and TRICARE Health Plan (\u201cTricare\u201d), the U.S. military\u2019s healthcare program administered through the DoD. \u200bThe Plaintiffs challenged a TRICARE provision that bars coverage of any surgery that \u201cimproves physical appearance\u201d without \u201csignificantly restor[ing] functions,\u201d including \u201csex gender changes.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1079(a)(11). The plaintiffs contended that this exclusion barred the former service member\u2019s daughter from receiving necessary procedures to treat her diagnosed gender dysphoria. They alleged the Defendants\u2019 enforcement of this provision to deny coverage of medically necessary gender transition surgeries violated the Plaintiffs\u2019 Equal Protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\nPlaintiffs, represented by GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) and private counsel, brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1079 (a)(11) (\u201cSection 1079\u201d), which mandates the categorical exclusion of all surgical treatments for gender transition in the military\u2019s medical coverage for eligible dependents of service members, violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs also alleged that TRICARE\u2019s refusal to cover surgical treatments for gender transition for eligible dependents of service members, including by the application and enforcement of the exclusion in Section 1079, violated the federal Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. Plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment, permanent injunctive relief to prevent the enforcement of the statutory exclusion, damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on January 27, 2023, in which they added an additional plaintiff, another transgender woman and dependent of a former service member who had been denied healthcare coverage by TRICARE for surgical procedures necessary to treat her gender dysphoria.\n\nOn December 1, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and a stipulation of voluntary dismissal, in which they dismissed with prejudice their Due Process and Rehabilitation Act claims, and withdrew their damage claims. The DoD filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on February 16, 2024, and both parties completed their briefing on the cross-motions for summary judgment by April 5, 2024.\n\nOn November 1, 2024, District Judge Nancy Torresen granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on their as-applied Equal Protection claim, finding that the TRICARE statutory exclusion discriminated based on sex and transgender status. The court relied on well-established precedents which instruct that sex- and gender-based classifications invoke intermediate scrutiny, and on Bostock v. Clayton County [../../../../case/17313], 590 U.S. 644, 669 (2020) to apply intermediate scrutiny to claims of gender-identity discrimination. Applying intermediate scrutiny, the court found that the DoD failed to identify any important governmental objective to justify the exclusion and raised only technical and procedural objections to the plaintiffs\u2019 Equal Protection claims; accordingly, the court granted partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs as to their as-applied Equal Protection claim. However, the court granted partial summary judgment to the DoD as to the plaintiffs' facial Equal Protection claim, finding that the statute could be interpreted in a constitutional manner. The court issued a declaratory judgment stating that the statutory exclusion was unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiffs, and ordered the parties to meet and confer by November 15, 2024 to determine whether injunctive relief was necessary.\n\nFollowing the Court\u2019s order to meet and confer, the parties filed a joint order on November 15, 2024, stating that they have conferred and jointly believed that all remaining issues in the case could be resolved through settlement without the need for further Court intervention, and that no injunctive relief was necessary at the time of the filing. The parties also requested that the Court defer entering a judgment while settlement negotiations were ongoing.\n\nOn December 13, 2024, the House of Representatives filed a Motion to Intervene and stated its intent to appeal the Court\u2019s decision on the cross-motions for summary judgment once the Court entered judgment in this case. Specifically, the House of Representatives noted its intent to appeal the Court\u2019s determination that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause as applied to the plaintiffs and to defend the constitutionality of the statute, claiming that the Department of Justice had failed to substantively defend the statute\u2019s constitutionality and noting that the DOJ appeared unlikely to contest the Court\u2019s decision.\n\nIn a December 16, 2024 Joint Status Report, the parties reiterated their belief that the case should be resolved via a settlement agreement and expressed their mutual opposition to the House of Representatives\u2019 motion to intervene. On December 20, 2024, the parties voluntarily dismissed the case with prejudice and without attorneys\u2019 fees or costs to either party. Two days later, the House of Representatives filed a notice in the case, in which it claimed that its pending intervention motion was not moot following the stipulated dismissal of the case. On January 3, 2025, both parties to the case filed responses opposing the House of Representatives\u2019 intervention in the case; on January 8, 2025, the House withdrew its motion to intervene.\n\nGiven that the motion to intervene has been withdrawn and the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal of the case, this case is effectively closed.",

    "target": "In this case challenging the constitutionality of a 1976 federal statute that prohibits the Military Health System from providing coverage for medically necessary surgical treatments for gender dysphoria for dependents of service members, a federal district court judge held that the prohibition violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nOn December 1, 2022, a \u200btransgender woman receiving health insurance through the U.S. military's TRICARE program as a dependent of a former servicemember and her father, a former servicemember, filed the case in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine. The plaintiffs sued the Secretary of Defense, the U.S. Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d), its component agency U.S. Defense Health Agency, and TRICARE Health Plan (\u201cTricare\u201d), the U.S. military\u2019s healthcare program administered through the DoD. \u200bThe Plaintiffs challenged a TRICARE provision that bars coverage of any surgery that \u201cimproves physical appearance\u201d without \u201csignificantly restor[ing] functions,\u201d including \u201csex gender changes.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1079(a)(11). The plaintiffs contended that this exclusion barred the former service member\u2019s daughter from receiving necessary procedures to treat her diagnosed gender dysphoria. They alleged the Defendants\u2019 enforcement of this provision to deny coverage of medically necessary gender transition surgeries violated the Plaintiffs\u2019 Equal Protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\nPlaintiffs, represented by GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) and private counsel, brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1079 (a)(11) (\u201cSection 1079\u201d), which mandates the categorical exclusion of all surgical treatments for gender transition in the military\u2019s medical coverage for eligible dependents of service members, violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs also alleged that TRICARE\u2019s refusal to cover surgical treatments for gender transition for eligible dependents of service members, including by the application and enforcement of the exclusion in Section 1079, violated the federal Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. Plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment, permanent injunctive relief to prevent the enforcement of the statutory exclusion, damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on January 27, 2023, in which they added an additional plaintiff, another transgender woman and dependent of a former service member who had been denied healthcare coverage by TRICARE for surgical procedures necessary to treat her gender dysphoria.\n\nOn December 1, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and a stipulation of voluntary dismissal, in which they dismissed with prejudice their Due Process and Rehabilitation Act claims, and withdrew their damage claims. The DoD filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on February 16, 2024, and both parties completed their briefing on the cross-motions for summary judgment by April 5, 2024.\n\nOn November 1, 2024, District Judge Nancy Torresen granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on their as-applied Equal Protection claim, finding that the TRICARE statutory exclusion discriminated based on sex and transgender status. The court relied on well-established precedents which instruct that sex- and gender-based classifications invoke intermediate scrutiny, and on Bostock v. Clayton County [../../../../case/17313], 590 U.S. 644, 669 (2020) to apply intermediate scrutiny to claims of gender-identity discrimination. Applying intermediate scrutiny, the court found that the DoD failed to identify any important governmental objective to justify the exclusion and raised only technical and procedural objections to the plaintiffs\u2019 Equal Protection claims; accordingly, the court granted partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs as to their as-applied Equal Protection claim. However, the court granted partial summary judgment to the DoD as to the plaintiffs' facial Equal Protection claim, finding that the statute could be interpreted in a constitutional manner. The court issued a declaratory judgment stating that the statutory exclusion was unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiffs, and ordered the parties to meet and confer by November 15, 2024 to determine whether injunctive relief was necessary.\n\nFollowing the Court\u2019s order to meet and confer, the parties filed a joint order on November 15, 2024, stating that they have conferred and jointly believed that all remaining issues in the case could be resolved through settlement without the need for further Court intervention, and that no injunctive relief was necessary at the time of the filing. The parties also requested that the Court defer entering a judgment while settlement negotiations were ongoing.\n\nOn December 13, 2024, the House of Representatives filed a Motion to Intervene and stated its intent to appeal the Court\u2019s decision on the cross-motions for summary judgment once the Court entered judgment in this case. Specifically, the House of Representatives noted its intent to appeal the Court\u2019s determination that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause as applied to the plaintiffs and to defend the constitutionality of the statute, claiming that the Department of Justice had failed to substantively defend the statute\u2019s constitutionality and noting that the DOJ appeared unlikely to contest the Court\u2019s decision.\n\nIn a December 16, 2024 Joint Status Report, the parties reiterated their belief that the case should be resolved via a settlement agreement and expressed their mutual opposition to the House of Representatives\u2019 motion to intervene. On December 20, 2024, the parties voluntarily dismissed the case with prejudice and without attorneys\u2019 fees or costs to either party. Two days later, the House of Representatives filed a notice in the case, in which it claimed that its pending intervention motion was not moot following the stipulated dismissal of the case. On January 3, 2025, both parties to the case filed responses opposing the House of Representatives\u2019 intervention in the case; on January 8, 2025, the House withdrew its motion to intervene.\n\nGiven that the motion to intervene has been withdrawn and the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal of the case, this case is effectively closed.",

    "target": "In this case challenging the constitutionality of a 1976 federal statute that prohibits the Military Health System from providing coverage for medically necessary surgical treatments for gender dysphoria for dependents of service members, a federal district court judge held that the prohibition violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nOn December 1, 2022, a \u200btransgender woman receiving health insurance through the U.S. military's TRICARE program as a dependent of a former servicemember and her father, a former servicemember, filed the case in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine. The plaintiffs sued the Secretary of Defense, the U.S. Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d), its component agency U.S. Defense Health Agency, and TRICARE Health Plan (\u201cTricare\u201d), the U.S. military\u2019s healthcare program administered through the DoD. \u200bThe Plaintiffs challenged a TRICARE provision that bars coverage of any surgery that \u201cimproves physical appearance\u201d without \u201csignificantly restor[ing] functions,\u201d including \u201csex gender changes.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1079(a)(11). The plaintiffs contended that this exclusion barred the former service member\u2019s daughter from receiving necessary procedures to treat her diagnosed gender dysphoria. They alleged the Defendants\u2019 enforcement of this provision to deny coverage of medically necessary gender transition surgeries violated the Plaintiffs\u2019 Equal Protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\nPlaintiffs, represented by GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) and private counsel, brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1079 (a)(11) (\u201cSection 1079\u201d), which mandates the categorical exclusion of all surgical treatments for gender transition in the military\u2019s medical coverage for eligible dependents of service members, violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs also alleged that TRICARE\u2019s refusal to cover surgical treatments for gender transition for eligible dependents of service members, including by the application and enforcement of the exclusion in Section 1079, violated the federal Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. Plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment, permanent injunctive relief to prevent the enforcement of the statutory exclusion, damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on January 27, 2023, in which they added an additional plaintiff, another transgender woman and dependent of a former service member who had been denied healthcare coverage by TRICARE for surgical procedures necessary to treat her gender dysphoria.\n\nOn December 1, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and a stipulation of voluntary dismissal, in which they dismissed with prejudice their Due Process and Rehabilitation Act claims, and withdrew their damage claims. The DoD filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on February 16, 2024, and both parties completed their briefing on the cross-motions for summary judgment by April 5, 2024.\n\nOn November 1, 2024, District Judge Nancy Torresen granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on their as-applied Equal Protection claim, finding that the TRICARE statutory exclusion discriminated based on sex and transgender status. The court relied on well-established precedents which instruct that sex- and gender-based classifications invoke intermediate scrutiny, and on Bostock v. Clayton County [../../../../case/17313], 590 U.S. 644, 669 (2020) to apply intermediate scrutiny to claims of gender-identity discrimination. Applying intermediate scrutiny, the court found that the DoD failed to identify any important governmental objective to justify the exclusion and raised only technical and procedural objections to the plaintiffs\u2019 Equal Protection claims; accordingly, the court granted partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs as to their as-applied Equal Protection claim. However, the court granted partial summary judgment to the DoD as to the plaintiffs' facial Equal Protection claim, finding that the statute could be interpreted in a constitutional manner. The court issued a declaratory judgment stating that the statutory exclusion was unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiffs, and ordered the parties to meet and confer by November 15, 2024 to determine whether injunctive relief was necessary.\n\nFollowing the Court\u2019s order to meet and confer, the parties filed a joint order on November 15, 2024, stating that they have conferred and jointly believed that all remaining issues in the case could be resolved through settlement without the need for further Court intervention, and that no injunctive relief was necessary at the time of the filing. The parties also requested that the Court defer entering a judgment while settlement negotiations were ongoing.\n\nOn December 13, 2024, the House of Representatives filed a Motion to Intervene and stated its intent to appeal the Court\u2019s decision on the cross-motions for summary judgment once the Court entered judgment in this case. Specifically, the House of Representatives noted its intent to appeal the Court\u2019s determination that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause as applied to the plaintiffs and to defend the constitutionality of the statute, claiming that the Department of Justice had failed to substantively defend the statute\u2019s constitutionality and noting that the DOJ appeared unlikely to contest the Court\u2019s decision.\n\nIn a December 16, 2024 Joint Status Report, the parties reiterated their belief that the case should be resolved via a settlement agreement and expressed their mutual opposition to the House of Representatives\u2019 motion to intervene. On December 20, 2024, the parties voluntarily dismissed the case with prejudice and without attorneys\u2019 fees or costs to either party. Two days later, the House of Representatives filed a notice in the case, in which it claimed that its pending intervention motion was not moot following the stipulated dismissal of the case. On January 3, 2025, both parties to the case filed responses opposing the House of Representatives\u2019 intervention in the case; on January 8, 2025, the House withdrew its motion to intervene.\n\nGiven that the motion to intervene has been withdrawn and the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal of the case, this case is effectively closed.",
