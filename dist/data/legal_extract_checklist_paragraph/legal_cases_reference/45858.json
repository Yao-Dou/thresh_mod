    "target": "Involuntarily unhoused residents of the City of San Rafael, California, filed this lawsuit pro se on August 11, 2023, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, requested a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to stop the City of San Rafael from enforcing ordinances that the plaintiffs alleged criminalized homelessness by making \u201ccamping\u201d on public property a criminal offense. The plaintiffs were ten unhoused individuals and Camp Integrity, an unincorporated association of people and property where the unhoused individual plaintiffs lived. They sued the City of San Rafael and its Chief of Police under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Plaintiffs alleged that the City\u2019s ordinance violated their rights under the First, Eighth, Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The plaintiffs argued that the ordinances criminalized survival activities, including eating and possessing public belongings in public spaces, and unconstitutionally targeted unhoused individuals while permitting identical conduct by people who had housing. They further argued that the ordinances criminalized homelessness by banning sleeping on public property while the City of San Rafael failed to provide enough alternative shelter for the City\u2019s homeless population. The case was assigned to Judge Edward M. Chen.\n\nOn August 15, 2023, Judge Trina Thompson held a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order. The following day, she granted the motion for a temporary restraining order, enjoining the city from enforcing the ordinance until a hearing on the preliminary injunction could be held. The court determined that the plaintiffs sufficiently showed that they were likely to suffer irreparable injury if the ordinance went into effect, that the plaintiffs would endure serious hardships under the ordinance, that temporary relief would serve the public interest, and that there were \u201cserious questions\u201d on the merits of the case. On September 6, 2023, the court held a non-evidentiary hearing on the preliminary injunction and the defendant officials of the City of San Rafael were served. The court extended the temporary restraining order on September 7, 2023.\n\nThe court held a settlement conference with the parties on September 20, 2023. The plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint on September 26, 2023, adding as plaintiffs two additional individuals and the San Rafael Homeless Union. The court held a hearing for the motion on the preliminary injunction on October 2 and 3 and granted in part and denied in part the preliminary injunction on October 19. The court permitted the City to enforce the ordinance but required the City to: allow 400 square feet campsites housing up to four people that were 100 feet apart; provide assistance to campers who needed to move to a designated space; provide replacements to plaintiffs who did not have tents or bedding that could fit within the compliant space; designate the permissible campsites that complied with the ordinance as modified by the preliminary injunction on street level maps; establish a registration process so campers could find permitted campsites; and not evict or prosecute any plaintiff who submitted a request for a reasonable accommodation based on disability unless they were provided with due process. There was also a mens rea requirement for violating camping regulations. The preliminary injunction applied only to residents of the encampment who had standing under this lawsuit as named plaintiffs or as members of the San Rafael Homeless Union.\n\nOn October 26, 2023, one of the named plaintiffs filed an ex parte motion seeking a temporary restraining order to stop the defendants from disrupting his campsite and arresting him for using a pallet under his tent as a foundation. The City opposed the plaintiff\u2019s motion. On November 1, 2023, the court held a status conference and a hearing on the temporary restraining order, which the court denied the following day.\n\nThe court held additional settlement conferences monthly from November 2023 until May 2024. On May 6, 2024, the City amended the ordinance in response to the Court\u2019s preliminary injunction. The amended ordinance allowed campties of 200 square feet for one person and 400 square feet for four individuals, a 10-foot setback from other campsites, and a mens rea requirement for violating camping regulations. Subsequently, the City filed a motion to dismiss the case, or alternatively, to dissolve the preliminary injunction, on May 10, 2024.\n\nThe City then filed a motion for limited relief from the injunction on June 12, 2024 under F.R.C.P. 60(b), as it sought to relocate ten to eleven individuals camping along Francisco Boulevard West in light of alleged fire risks to their encampment. The same day, the court, considering that notice had already been given that campers had 48 hours to relocate, scheduled a hearing on the motion for June 13, 2024. The court held hearings on June 13 and June 14, 2024, and on June 14, Judge Edward M. Chen issued an order conditionally granting the City\u2019s emergency motion for limited relief from the injunction. The court explained that it was an issue of fact whether any of the individuals whom the City sought to relocate from Francisco Boulevard West were covered by the preliminary injunction in this case, and after weighing the likelihood of irreparable injury, the balance of hardships, and the health and safety risks, the court concluded that moving the individuals from the encampment would be permissible.\n\nThe court held settlement conferences at the beginning and end of July 2024. On August 7, 2024, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and dissolved the preliminary injunction. The court determined that the plaintiffs had not shown a reasonable expectation that the government would reenact its regulation, that the ordinance as amended on May 6, 2024 did not raise the same issues as the original ordinance, and that because the amended ordinance had given the relief sought, the case was now moot. Therefore, the court no longer had jurisdiction to maintain the preliminary injunction, which was rendered moot as well. As of December 2024, this case is closed.",

    "target": "Involuntarily unhoused residents of the City of San Rafael, California, filed this lawsuit pro se on August 11, 2023, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, requested a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to stop the City of San Rafael from enforcing ordinances that the plaintiffs alleged criminalized homelessness by making \u201ccamping\u201d on public property a criminal offense. The plaintiffs were ten unhoused individuals and Camp Integrity, an unincorporated association of people and property where the unhoused individual plaintiffs lived. They sued the City of San Rafael and its Chief of Police under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Plaintiffs alleged that the City\u2019s ordinance violated their rights under the First, Eighth, Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The plaintiffs argued that the ordinances criminalized survival activities, including eating and possessing public belongings in public spaces, and unconstitutionally targeted unhoused individuals while permitting identical conduct by people who had housing. They further argued that the ordinances criminalized homelessness by banning sleeping on public property while the City of San Rafael failed to provide enough alternative shelter for the City\u2019s homeless population. The case was assigned to Judge Edward M. Chen.\n\nOn August 15, 2023, Judge Trina Thompson held a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order. The following day, she granted the motion for a temporary restraining order, enjoining the city from enforcing the ordinance until a hearing on the preliminary injunction could be held. The court determined that the plaintiffs sufficiently showed that they were likely to suffer irreparable injury if the ordinance went into effect, that the plaintiffs would endure serious hardships under the ordinance, that temporary relief would serve the public interest, and that there were \u201cserious questions\u201d on the merits of the case. On September 6, 2023, the court held a non-evidentiary hearing on the preliminary injunction and the defendant officials of the City of San Rafael were served. The court extended the temporary restraining order on September 7, 2023.\n\nThe court held a settlement conference with the parties on September 20, 2023. The plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint on September 26, 2023, adding as plaintiffs two additional individuals and the San Rafael Homeless Union. The court held a hearing for the motion on the preliminary injunction on October 2 and 3 and granted in part and denied in part the preliminary injunction on October 19. The court permitted the City to enforce the ordinance but required the City to: allow 400 square feet campsites housing up to four people that were 100 feet apart; provide assistance to campers who needed to move to a designated space; provide replacements to plaintiffs who did not have tents or bedding that could fit within the compliant space; designate the permissible campsites that complied with the ordinance as modified by the preliminary injunction on street level maps; establish a registration process so campers could find permitted campsites; and not evict or prosecute any plaintiff who submitted a request for a reasonable accommodation based on disability unless they were provided with due process. There was also a mens rea requirement for violating camping regulations. The preliminary injunction applied only to residents of the encampment who had standing under this lawsuit as named plaintiffs or as members of the San Rafael Homeless Union.\n\nOn October 26, 2023, one of the named plaintiffs filed an ex parte motion seeking a temporary restraining order to stop the defendants from disrupting his campsite and arresting him for using a pallet under his tent as a foundation. The City opposed the plaintiff\u2019s motion. On November 1, 2023, the court held a status conference and a hearing on the temporary restraining order, which the court denied the following day.\n\nThe court held additional settlement conferences monthly from November 2023 until May 2024. On May 6, 2024, the City amended the ordinance in response to the Court\u2019s preliminary injunction. The amended ordinance allowed campties of 200 square feet for one person and 400 square feet for four individuals, a 10-foot setback from other campsites, and a mens rea requirement for violating camping regulations. Subsequently, the City filed a motion to dismiss the case, or alternatively, to dissolve the preliminary injunction, on May 10, 2024.\n\nThe City then filed a motion for limited relief from the injunction on June 12, 2024 under F.R.C.P. 60(b), as it sought to relocate ten to eleven individuals camping along Francisco Boulevard West in light of alleged fire risks to their encampment. The same day, the court, considering that notice had already been given that campers had 48 hours to relocate, scheduled a hearing on the motion for June 13, 2024. The court held hearings on June 13 and June 14, 2024, and on June 14, Judge Edward M. Chen issued an order conditionally granting the City\u2019s emergency motion for limited relief from the injunction. The court explained that it was an issue of fact whether any of the individuals whom the City sought to relocate from Francisco Boulevard West were covered by the preliminary injunction in this case, and after weighing the likelihood of irreparable injury, the balance of hardships, and the health and safety risks, the court concluded that moving the individuals from the encampment would be permissible.\n\nThe court held settlement conferences at the beginning and end of July 2024. On August 7, 2024, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and dissolved the preliminary injunction. The court determined that the plaintiffs had not shown a reasonable expectation that the government would reenact its regulation, that the ordinance as amended on May 6, 2024 did not raise the same issues as the original ordinance, and that because the amended ordinance had given the relief sought, the case was now moot. Therefore, the court no longer had jurisdiction to maintain the preliminary injunction, which was rendered moot as well. As of December 2024, this case is closed.",

    "target": "Involuntarily unhoused residents of the City of San Rafael, California, filed this lawsuit pro se on August 11, 2023, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, requested a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to stop the City of San Rafael from enforcing ordinances that the plaintiffs alleged criminalized homelessness by making \u201ccamping\u201d on public property a criminal offense. The plaintiffs were ten unhoused individuals and Camp Integrity, an unincorporated association of people and property where the unhoused individual plaintiffs lived. They sued the City of San Rafael and its Chief of Police under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Plaintiffs alleged that the City\u2019s ordinance violated their rights under the First, Eighth, Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The plaintiffs argued that the ordinances criminalized survival activities, including eating and possessing public belongings in public spaces, and unconstitutionally targeted unhoused individuals while permitting identical conduct by people who had housing. They further argued that the ordinances criminalized homelessness by banning sleeping on public property while the City of San Rafael failed to provide enough alternative shelter for the City\u2019s homeless population. The case was assigned to Judge Edward M. Chen.\n\nOn August 15, 2023, Judge Trina Thompson held a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order. The following day, she granted the motion for a temporary restraining order, enjoining the city from enforcing the ordinance until a hearing on the preliminary injunction could be held. The court determined that the plaintiffs sufficiently showed that they were likely to suffer irreparable injury if the ordinance went into effect, that the plaintiffs would endure serious hardships under the ordinance, that temporary relief would serve the public interest, and that there were \u201cserious questions\u201d on the merits of the case. On September 6, 2023, the court held a non-evidentiary hearing on the preliminary injunction and the defendant officials of the City of San Rafael were served. The court extended the temporary restraining order on September 7, 2023.\n\nThe court held a settlement conference with the parties on September 20, 2023. The plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint on September 26, 2023, adding as plaintiffs two additional individuals and the San Rafael Homeless Union. The court held a hearing for the motion on the preliminary injunction on October 2 and 3 and granted in part and denied in part the preliminary injunction on October 19. The court permitted the City to enforce the ordinance but required the City to: allow 400 square feet campsites housing up to four people that were 100 feet apart; provide assistance to campers who needed to move to a designated space; provide replacements to plaintiffs who did not have tents or bedding that could fit within the compliant space; designate the permissible campsites that complied with the ordinance as modified by the preliminary injunction on street level maps; establish a registration process so campers could find permitted campsites; and not evict or prosecute any plaintiff who submitted a request for a reasonable accommodation based on disability unless they were provided with due process. There was also a mens rea requirement for violating camping regulations. The preliminary injunction applied only to residents of the encampment who had standing under this lawsuit as named plaintiffs or as members of the San Rafael Homeless Union.\n\nOn October 26, 2023, one of the named plaintiffs filed an ex parte motion seeking a temporary restraining order to stop the defendants from disrupting his campsite and arresting him for using a pallet under his tent as a foundation. The City opposed the plaintiff\u2019s motion. On November 1, 2023, the court held a status conference and a hearing on the temporary restraining order, which the court denied the following day.\n\nThe court held additional settlement conferences monthly from November 2023 until May 2024. On May 6, 2024, the City amended the ordinance in response to the Court\u2019s preliminary injunction. The amended ordinance allowed campties of 200 square feet for one person and 400 square feet for four individuals, a 10-foot setback from other campsites, and a mens rea requirement for violating camping regulations. Subsequently, the City filed a motion to dismiss the case, or alternatively, to dissolve the preliminary injunction, on May 10, 2024.\n\nThe City then filed a motion for limited relief from the injunction on June 12, 2024 under F.R.C.P. 60(b), as it sought to relocate ten to eleven individuals camping along Francisco Boulevard West in light of alleged fire risks to their encampment. The same day, the court, considering that notice had already been given that campers had 48 hours to relocate, scheduled a hearing on the motion for June 13, 2024. The court held hearings on June 13 and June 14, 2024, and on June 14, Judge Edward M. Chen issued an order conditionally granting the City\u2019s emergency motion for limited relief from the injunction. The court explained that it was an issue of fact whether any of the individuals whom the City sought to relocate from Francisco Boulevard West were covered by the preliminary injunction in this case, and after weighing the likelihood of irreparable injury, the balance of hardships, and the health and safety risks, the court concluded that moving the individuals from the encampment would be permissible.\n\nThe court held settlement conferences at the beginning and end of July 2024. On August 7, 2024, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and dissolved the preliminary injunction. The court determined that the plaintiffs had not shown a reasonable expectation that the government would reenact its regulation, that the ordinance as amended on May 6, 2024 did not raise the same issues as the original ordinance, and that because the amended ordinance had given the relief sought, the case was now moot. Therefore, the court no longer had jurisdiction to maintain the preliminary injunction, which was rendered moot as well. As of December 2024, this case is closed.",

    "target": "Involuntarily unhoused residents of the City of San Rafael, California, filed this lawsuit pro se on August 11, 2023, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, requested a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to stop the City of San Rafael from enforcing ordinances that the plaintiffs alleged criminalized homelessness by making \u201ccamping\u201d on public property a criminal offense. The plaintiffs were ten unhoused individuals and Camp Integrity, an unincorporated association of people and property where the unhoused individual plaintiffs lived. They sued the City of San Rafael and its Chief of Police under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Plaintiffs alleged that the City\u2019s ordinance violated their rights under the First, Eighth, Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The plaintiffs argued that the ordinances criminalized survival activities, including eating and possessing public belongings in public spaces, and unconstitutionally targeted unhoused individuals while permitting identical conduct by people who had housing. They further argued that the ordinances criminalized homelessness by banning sleeping on public property while the City of San Rafael failed to provide enough alternative shelter for the City\u2019s homeless population. The case was assigned to Judge Edward M. Chen.\n\nOn August 15, 2023, Judge Trina Thompson held a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order. The following day, she granted the motion for a temporary restraining order, enjoining the city from enforcing the ordinance until a hearing on the preliminary injunction could be held. The court determined that the plaintiffs sufficiently showed that they were likely to suffer irreparable injury if the ordinance went into effect, that the plaintiffs would endure serious hardships under the ordinance, that temporary relief would serve the public interest, and that there were \u201cserious questions\u201d on the merits of the case. On September 6, 2023, the court held a non-evidentiary hearing on the preliminary injunction and the defendant officials of the City of San Rafael were served. The court extended the temporary restraining order on September 7, 2023.\n\nThe court held a settlement conference with the parties on September 20, 2023. The plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint on September 26, 2023, adding as plaintiffs two additional individuals and the San Rafael Homeless Union. The court held a hearing for the motion on the preliminary injunction on October 2 and 3 and granted in part and denied in part the preliminary injunction on October 19. The court permitted the City to enforce the ordinance but required the City to: allow 400 square feet campsites housing up to four people that were 100 feet apart; provide assistance to campers who needed to move to a designated space; provide replacements to plaintiffs who did not have tents or bedding that could fit within the compliant space; designate the permissible campsites that complied with the ordinance as modified by the preliminary injunction on street level maps; establish a registration process so campers could find permitted campsites; and not evict or prosecute any plaintiff who submitted a request for a reasonable accommodation based on disability unless they were provided with due process. There was also a mens rea requirement for violating camping regulations. The preliminary injunction applied only to residents of the encampment who had standing under this lawsuit as named plaintiffs or as members of the San Rafael Homeless Union.\n\nOn October 26, 2023, one of the named plaintiffs filed an ex parte motion seeking a temporary restraining order to stop the defendants from disrupting his campsite and arresting him for using a pallet under his tent as a foundation. The City opposed the plaintiff\u2019s motion. On November 1, 2023, the court held a status conference and a hearing on the temporary restraining order, which the court denied the following day.\n\nThe court held additional settlement conferences monthly from November 2023 until May 2024. On May 6, 2024, the City amended the ordinance in response to the Court\u2019s preliminary injunction. The amended ordinance allowed campties of 200 square feet for one person and 400 square feet for four individuals, a 10-foot setback from other campsites, and a mens rea requirement for violating camping regulations. Subsequently, the City filed a motion to dismiss the case, or alternatively, to dissolve the preliminary injunction, on May 10, 2024.\n\nThe City then filed a motion for limited relief from the injunction on June 12, 2024 under F.R.C.P. 60(b), as it sought to relocate ten to eleven individuals camping along Francisco Boulevard West in light of alleged fire risks to their encampment. The same day, the court, considering that notice had already been given that campers had 48 hours to relocate, scheduled a hearing on the motion for June 13, 2024. The court held hearings on June 13 and June 14, 2024, and on June 14, Judge Edward M. Chen issued an order conditionally granting the City\u2019s emergency motion for limited relief from the injunction. The court explained that it was an issue of fact whether any of the individuals whom the City sought to relocate from Francisco Boulevard West were covered by the preliminary injunction in this case, and after weighing the likelihood of irreparable injury, the balance of hardships, and the health and safety risks, the court concluded that moving the individuals from the encampment would be permissible.\n\nThe court held settlement conferences at the beginning and end of July 2024. On August 7, 2024, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and dissolved the preliminary injunction. The court determined that the plaintiffs had not shown a reasonable expectation that the government would reenact its regulation, that the ordinance as amended on May 6, 2024 did not raise the same issues as the original ordinance, and that because the amended ordinance had given the relief sought, the case was now moot. Therefore, the court no longer had jurisdiction to maintain the preliminary injunction, which was rendered moot as well. As of December 2024, this case is closed.",

    "target": "Involuntarily unhoused residents of the City of San Rafael, California, filed this lawsuit pro se on August 11, 2023, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, requested a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to stop the City of San Rafael from enforcing ordinances that the plaintiffs alleged criminalized homelessness by making \u201ccamping\u201d on public property a criminal offense. The plaintiffs were ten unhoused individuals and Camp Integrity, an unincorporated association of people and property where the unhoused individual plaintiffs lived. They sued the City of San Rafael and its Chief of Police under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Plaintiffs alleged that the City\u2019s ordinance violated their rights under the First, Eighth, Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The plaintiffs argued that the ordinances criminalized survival activities, including eating and possessing public belongings in public spaces, and unconstitutionally targeted unhoused individuals while permitting identical conduct by people who had housing. They further argued that the ordinances criminalized homelessness by banning sleeping on public property while the City of San Rafael failed to provide enough alternative shelter for the City\u2019s homeless population. The case was assigned to Judge Edward M. Chen.\n\nOn August 15, 2023, Judge Trina Thompson held a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order. The following day, she granted the motion for a temporary restraining order, enjoining the city from enforcing the ordinance until a hearing on the preliminary injunction could be held. The court determined that the plaintiffs sufficiently showed that they were likely to suffer irreparable injury if the ordinance went into effect, that the plaintiffs would endure serious hardships under the ordinance, that temporary relief would serve the public interest, and that there were \u201cserious questions\u201d on the merits of the case. On September 6, 2023, the court held a non-evidentiary hearing on the preliminary injunction and the defendant officials of the City of San Rafael were served. The court extended the temporary restraining order on September 7, 2023.\n\nThe court held a settlement conference with the parties on September 20, 2023. The plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint on September 26, 2023, adding as plaintiffs two additional individuals and the San Rafael Homeless Union. The court held a hearing for the motion on the preliminary injunction on October 2 and 3 and granted in part and denied in part the preliminary injunction on October 19. The court permitted the City to enforce the ordinance but required the City to: allow 400 square feet campsites housing up to four people that were 100 feet apart; provide assistance to campers who needed to move to a designated space; provide replacements to plaintiffs who did not have tents or bedding that could fit within the compliant space; designate the permissible campsites that complied with the ordinance as modified by the preliminary injunction on street level maps; establish a registration process so campers could find permitted campsites; and not evict or prosecute any plaintiff who submitted a request for a reasonable accommodation based on disability unless they were provided with due process. There was also a mens rea requirement for violating camping regulations. The preliminary injunction applied only to residents of the encampment who had standing under this lawsuit as named plaintiffs or as members of the San Rafael Homeless Union.\n\nOn October 26, 2023, one of the named plaintiffs filed an ex parte motion seeking a temporary restraining order to stop the defendants from disrupting his campsite and arresting him for using a pallet under his tent as a foundation. The City opposed the plaintiff\u2019s motion. On November 1, 2023, the court held a status conference and a hearing on the temporary restraining order, which the court denied the following day.\n\nThe court held additional settlement conferences monthly from November 2023 until May 2024. On May 6, 2024, the City amended the ordinance in response to the Court\u2019s preliminary injunction. The amended ordinance allowed campties of 200 square feet for one person and 400 square feet for four individuals, a 10-foot setback from other campsites, and a mens rea requirement for violating camping regulations. Subsequently, the City filed a motion to dismiss the case, or alternatively, to dissolve the preliminary injunction, on May 10, 2024.\n\nThe City then filed a motion for limited relief from the injunction on June 12, 2024 under F.R.C.P. 60(b), as it sought to relocate ten to eleven individuals camping along Francisco Boulevard West in light of alleged fire risks to their encampment. The same day, the court, considering that notice had already been given that campers had 48 hours to relocate, scheduled a hearing on the motion for June 13, 2024. The court held hearings on June 13 and June 14, 2024, and on June 14, Judge Edward M. Chen issued an order conditionally granting the City\u2019s emergency motion for limited relief from the injunction. The court explained that it was an issue of fact whether any of the individuals whom the City sought to relocate from Francisco Boulevard West were covered by the preliminary injunction in this case, and after weighing the likelihood of irreparable injury, the balance of hardships, and the health and safety risks, the court concluded that moving the individuals from the encampment would be permissible.\n\nThe court held settlement conferences at the beginning and end of July 2024. On August 7, 2024, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and dissolved the preliminary injunction. The court determined that the plaintiffs had not shown a reasonable expectation that the government would reenact its regulation, that the ordinance as amended on May 6, 2024 did not raise the same issues as the original ordinance, and that because the amended ordinance had given the relief sought, the case was now moot. Therefore, the court no longer had jurisdiction to maintain the preliminary injunction, which was rendered moot as well. As of December 2024, this case is closed.",
