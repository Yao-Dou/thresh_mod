    "target": "On September 19, 2019, five asylum-seeking parents, on their own behalf and on behalf of their minor children, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiffs sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"). The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, the National Immigrant Justice Center, and the American Immigration Council, sought monetary relief and attorneys fees. The plaintiffs alleged both negligence on part of the United States government and that the government caused intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\") through its child-separation policy. The government separated the asylum-seeking parents from their children, delayed providing parents and children information of each other\u2019s whereabouts and well-being, failed to facilitate adequate communication between the parents and their children while separated, and failed to implement a system to ensure families could be reunited. The government did this deliberately, plaintiffs alleged, to deter other parents with children from seeking asylum in the United States. The case was assigned to Judge Susan Bolton.\n\nOn December 23, 2019, the United States moved to dismiss the suit for lack of jurisdiction, citing sovereign immunity not waived by the FTCA. The district court denied the United States' motion on March 30, 2020, holding (1) the family separation alleged in the suit was a persuasive analogy to private conduct such that plaintiffs had established subject-matter jurisdiction under the FTCA and (2) neither the due care nor the discretionary function exception to the FTCA applied because the United States was not enforcing federal law when it separated plaintiffs and their children. 2020 WL 1698191. The United States moved for leave to appeal the district court's order on May 29, 2020, which was denied by the Judge Bolton on July 6, 2020 because the United States failed to present exceptional circumstances such that interlocutory review would be appropriate. 2020 WL 5232560.\n\nThe United States filed its answer to the complaint on May 13, 2020 and the parties commenced discovery in July 2020. The parties filed numerous joint motions to stay proceedings while they explored a possible settlement. During this time, the 2020 presidential election resulted in a transfer of power from the Trump Administration to the Biden Administration.\n\nProceedings remained stayed until January 27, 2022 when the Court scheduled a status conference. Following the status conference, discovery continued through 2022. In January 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion for sanctions seeking evidentiary sanctions against the defendants for the production of documents after the close of discovery.\n\nThe United States filed a motion for summary judgment and submitted a statement of facts on March 9, 2023. The defendant denounced the challenged separation of families procedures as the policy decisions made by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice during the former Trump Administration. Nonetheless, the defendant contended that the FTCA does not permit recovery in tort for harms asserted to arise from policy decisions (the so-called discretionary function exception). The plaintiffs also filed a motion for partial summary judgment on March 9 specifically with regard to their IIED and negligence claims.\n\nOn August 15, 2023, the District Court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs' motion for sanctions. The Court granted for the admission of the certain documents and handwritten notes if offered by the plaintiffs at trial and precluded the defendants from using them.\n\nOn October 24, 2023, the Court also denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, while granting in part the plaintiffs' motion. The Court denied the defendant's motion because they had not shown that the discretionary function exception barred the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. With regard to the plaintiffs' negligence claim, the Court concluded that the United States owed the plaintiffs a duty of care, but determined that issues of material fact existed as to whether the United States breached its duty. The Court denied the plaintiffs' IIED claim. 2023 WL 7102132.\n\nFollowing a scheduling conference, a bench trial was set for April 23, 2024. However, on April 10, 2024, the parties filed a notice of conditional settlements with regard to all claims. That same day, the court granted the stipulation and vacated the pretrial and trial deadlines it had originally set.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the parties moved for court approval over the settlement agreement, which the court then granted the next day. The plaintiffs received $1,353,000. The portion of the settlement for the minor plaintiffs were placed in a pooled trust.\n\nThe parties then proceeded to file status updates every 60 days with the court with regard to finalization of the settlement. Following resolution, on October 17, 2024, the plaintiff moved to dismiss the case. The court, thus, dismissed the case with prejudice on October 22, 2024.\n\nThe case is considered closed.",

    "target": "On September 19, 2019, five asylum-seeking parents, on their own behalf and on behalf of their minor children, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiffs sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"). The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, the National Immigrant Justice Center, and the American Immigration Council, sought monetary relief and attorneys fees. The plaintiffs alleged both negligence on part of the United States government and that the government caused intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\") through its child-separation policy. The government separated the asylum-seeking parents from their children, delayed providing parents and children information of each other\u2019s whereabouts and well-being, failed to facilitate adequate communication between the parents and their children while separated, and failed to implement a system to ensure families could be reunited. The government did this deliberately, plaintiffs alleged, to deter other parents with children from seeking asylum in the United States. The case was assigned to Judge Susan Bolton.\n\nOn December 23, 2019, the United States moved to dismiss the suit for lack of jurisdiction, citing sovereign immunity not waived by the FTCA. The district court denied the United States' motion on March 30, 2020, holding (1) the family separation alleged in the suit was a persuasive analogy to private conduct such that plaintiffs had established subject-matter jurisdiction under the FTCA and (2) neither the due care nor the discretionary function exception to the FTCA applied because the United States was not enforcing federal law when it separated plaintiffs and their children. 2020 WL 1698191. The United States moved for leave to appeal the district court's order on May 29, 2020, which was denied by the Judge Bolton on July 6, 2020 because the United States failed to present exceptional circumstances such that interlocutory review would be appropriate. 2020 WL 5232560.\n\nThe United States filed its answer to the complaint on May 13, 2020 and the parties commenced discovery in July 2020. The parties filed numerous joint motions to stay proceedings while they explored a possible settlement. During this time, the 2020 presidential election resulted in a transfer of power from the Trump Administration to the Biden Administration.\n\nProceedings remained stayed until January 27, 2022 when the Court scheduled a status conference. Following the status conference, discovery continued through 2022. In January 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion for sanctions seeking evidentiary sanctions against the defendants for the production of documents after the close of discovery.\n\nThe United States filed a motion for summary judgment and submitted a statement of facts on March 9, 2023. The defendant denounced the challenged separation of families procedures as the policy decisions made by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice during the former Trump Administration. Nonetheless, the defendant contended that the FTCA does not permit recovery in tort for harms asserted to arise from policy decisions (the so-called discretionary function exception). The plaintiffs also filed a motion for partial summary judgment on March 9 specifically with regard to their IIED and negligence claims.\n\nOn August 15, 2023, the District Court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs' motion for sanctions. The Court granted for the admission of the certain documents and handwritten notes if offered by the plaintiffs at trial and precluded the defendants from using them.\n\nOn October 24, 2023, the Court also denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, while granting in part the plaintiffs' motion. The Court denied the defendant's motion because they had not shown that the discretionary function exception barred the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. With regard to the plaintiffs' negligence claim, the Court concluded that the United States owed the plaintiffs a duty of care, but determined that issues of material fact existed as to whether the United States breached its duty. The Court denied the plaintiffs' IIED claim. 2023 WL 7102132.\n\nFollowing a scheduling conference, a bench trial was set for April 23, 2024. However, on April 10, 2024, the parties filed a notice of conditional settlements with regard to all claims. That same day, the court granted the stipulation and vacated the pretrial and trial deadlines it had originally set.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the parties moved for court approval over the settlement agreement, which the court then granted the next day. The plaintiffs received $1,353,000. The portion of the settlement for the minor plaintiffs were placed in a pooled trust.\n\nThe parties then proceeded to file status updates every 60 days with the court with regard to finalization of the settlement. Following resolution, on October 17, 2024, the plaintiff moved to dismiss the case. The court, thus, dismissed the case with prejudice on October 22, 2024.\n\nThe case is considered closed.",

The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, the National Immigrant Justice Center, and the American Immigration Council, sought monetary relief and attorneys fees. The plaintiffs alleged both negligence on part of the United States government and that the government caused intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\") through its child-separation policy. The government separated the asylum-seeking parents from their children, delayed providing parents and children information of each other\u2019s whereabouts and well-being, failed to facilitate adequate communication between the parents and their children while separated, and failed to implement a system to ensure families could be reunited. The government did this deliberately, plaintiffs alleged, to deter other parents with children from seeking asylum in the United States. The case was assigned to Judge Susan Bolton.\n\nOn December 23, 2019, the United States moved to dismiss the suit for lack of jurisdiction, citing sovereign immunity not waived by the FTCA. The district court denied the United States' motion on March 30, 2020, holding (1) the family separation alleged in the suit was a persuasive analogy to private conduct such that plaintiffs had established subject-matter jurisdiction under the FTCA and (2) neither the due care nor the discretionary function exception to the FTCA applied because the United States was not enforcing federal law when it separated plaintiffs and their children. 2020 WL 1698191. The United States moved for leave to appeal the district court's order on May 29, 2020, which was denied by the Judge Bolton on July 6, 2020 because the United States failed to present exceptional circumstances such that interlocutory review would be appropriate. 2020 WL 5232560.\n\nThe United States filed its answer to the complaint on May 13, 2020 and the parties commenced discovery in July 2020. The parties filed numerous joint motions to stay proceedings while they explored a possible settlement. During this time, the 2020 presidential election resulted in a transfer of power from the Trump Administration to the Biden Administration.\n\nProceedings remained stayed until January 27, 2022 when the Court scheduled a status conference. Following the status conference, discovery continued through 2022. In January 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion for sanctions seeking evidentiary sanctions against the defendants for the production of documents after the close of discovery.\n\nThe United States filed a motion for summary judgment and submitted a statement of facts on March 9, 2023. The defendant denounced the challenged separation of families procedures as the policy decisions made by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice during the former Trump Administration. Nonetheless, the defendant contended that the FTCA does not permit recovery in tort for harms asserted to arise from policy decisions (the so-called discretionary function exception). The plaintiffs also filed a motion for partial summary judgment on March 9 specifically with regard to their IIED and negligence claims.\n\nOn August 15, 2023, the District Court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs' motion for sanctions. The Court granted for the admission of the certain documents and handwritten notes if offered by the plaintiffs at trial and precluded the defendants from using them.\n\nOn October 24, 2023, the Court also denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, while granting in part the plaintiffs' motion. The Court denied the defendant's motion because they had not shown that the discretionary function exception barred the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. With regard to the plaintiffs' negligence claim, the Court concluded that the United States owed the plaintiffs a duty of care, but determined that issues of material fact existed as to whether the United States breached its duty. The Court denied the plaintiffs' IIED claim. 2023 WL 7102132.\n\nFollowing a scheduling conference, a bench trial was set for April 23, 2024. However, on April 10, 2024, the parties filed a notice of conditional settlements with regard to all claims. That same day, the court granted the stipulation and vacated the pretrial and trial deadlines it had originally set.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the parties moved for court approval over the settlement agreement, which the court then granted the next day. The plaintiffs received $1,353,000. The portion of the settlement for the minor plaintiffs were placed in a pooled trust.\n\nThe parties then proceeded to file status updates every 60 days with the court with regard to finalization of the settlement. Following resolution, on October 17, 2024, the plaintiff moved to dismiss the case. The court, thus, dismissed the case with prejudice on October 22, 2024.\n\nThe case is considered closed.",

    "target": "On September 19, 2019, five asylum-seeking parents, on their own behalf and on behalf of their minor children, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiffs sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"). The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, the National Immigrant Justice Center, and the American Immigration Council, sought monetary relief and attorneys fees. The plaintiffs alleged both negligence on part of the United States government and that the government caused intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\") through its child-separation policy. The government separated the asylum-seeking parents from their children, delayed providing parents and children information of each other\u2019s whereabouts and well-being, failed to facilitate adequate communication between the parents and their children while separated, and failed to implement a system to ensure families could be reunited. The government did this deliberately, plaintiffs alleged, to deter other parents with children from seeking asylum in the United States. The case was assigned to Judge Susan Bolton.\n\nOn December 23, 2019, the United States moved to dismiss the suit for lack of jurisdiction, citing sovereign immunity not waived by the FTCA. The district court denied the United States' motion on March 30, 2020, holding (1) the family separation alleged in the suit was a persuasive analogy to private conduct such that plaintiffs had established subject-matter jurisdiction under the FTCA and (2) neither the due care nor the discretionary function exception to the FTCA applied because the United States was not enforcing federal law when it separated plaintiffs and their children. 2020 WL 1698191. The United States moved for leave to appeal the district court's order on May 29, 2020, which was denied by the Judge Bolton on July 6, 2020 because the United States failed to present exceptional circumstances such that interlocutory review would be appropriate. 2020 WL 5232560.\n\nThe United States filed its answer to the complaint on May 13, 2020 and the parties commenced discovery in July 2020. The parties filed numerous joint motions to stay proceedings while they explored a possible settlement. During this time, the 2020 presidential election resulted in a transfer of power from the Trump Administration to the Biden Administration.\n\nProceedings remained stayed until January 27, 2022 when the Court scheduled a status conference. Following the status conference, discovery continued through 2022. In January 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion for sanctions seeking evidentiary sanctions against the defendants for the production of documents after the close of discovery.\n\nThe United States filed a motion for summary judgment and submitted a statement of facts on March 9, 2023. The defendant denounced the challenged separation of families procedures as the policy decisions made by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice during the former Trump Administration. Nonetheless, the defendant contended that the FTCA does not permit recovery in tort for harms asserted to arise from policy decisions (the so-called discretionary function exception). The plaintiffs also filed a motion for partial summary judgment on March 9 specifically with regard to their IIED and negligence claims.\n\nOn August 15, 2023, the District Court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs' motion for sanctions. The Court granted for the admission of the certain documents and handwritten notes if offered by the plaintiffs at trial and precluded the defendants from using them.\n\nOn October 24, 2023, the Court also denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, while granting in part the plaintiffs' motion. The Court denied the defendant's motion because they had not shown that the discretionary function exception barred the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. With regard to the plaintiffs' negligence claim, the Court concluded that the United States owed the plaintiffs a duty of care, but determined that issues of material fact existed as to whether the United States breached its duty. The Court denied the plaintiffs' IIED claim. 2023 WL 7102132.\n\nFollowing a scheduling conference, a bench trial was set for April 23, 2024. However, on April 10, 2024, the parties filed a notice of conditional settlements with regard to all claims. That same day, the court granted the stipulation and vacated the pretrial and trial deadlines it had originally set.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the parties moved for court approval over the settlement agreement, which the court then granted the next day. The plaintiffs received $1,353,000. The portion of the settlement for the minor plaintiffs were placed in a pooled trust.\n\nThe parties then proceeded to file status updates every 60 days with the court with regard to finalization of the settlement. Following resolution, on October 17, 2024, the plaintiff moved to dismiss the case. The court, thus, dismissed the case with prejudice on October 22, 2024.\n\nThe case is considered closed.",
