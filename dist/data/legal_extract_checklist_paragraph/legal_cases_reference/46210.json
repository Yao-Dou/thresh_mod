    "target": "This case challenges the carcinogenic chloroprene emissions from Denka Performance Elastomer, LLC\u2019s (Denka\u2019s) neoprene manufacturing facility at the Pontchartrain Works Site in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana, as being unacceptably high under EPA regulations. Denka's facility produced neoprene, a synthetic rubber, emitting chloroprene\u2014a chemical classified by the EPA in 2010 as likely carcinogenic to humans. Air monitoring near the facility reportedly detected chloroprene concentrations up to 14 times the EPA's recommended levels, posing a risk to the majority-Black population surrounding the facility.\n\nOn February 28, 2023, the United States government filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Plaintiff sued Denka Performance Elastomer LLC, the owner and operator of a neoprene manufacturing facility, and DuPont Specialty Products, the owner of the land on which the neoprene manufacturing facility was located and leased to Defendant Denka. Plaintiff sued Defendant Denka under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7603, alleging that Defendant Denka's chloroprene emissions from its neoprene manufacturing facility in LaPlace, Louisiana, posed an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health across communities in St. John the Baptist Parish. \u200bPlaintiff sued Defendant DuPont under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a) and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, as Defendant Denka may need permission or cooperation from Defendant DuPont to take the necessary actions to abate the imminent and substantial endangerment posed by its current chloroprene emissions.\n\nPlaintiff sought injunctive relief requiring that Defendant Denka immediately reduce its chloroprene emissions to levels that no longer cause or contribute to unacceptably high cancer risks within the communities surrounding the facility. Plaintiff also sought an injunctive relief ordering Defendant DuPont to authorize and not impede construction and necessary measures for Defendant Denka to comply with the court\u2019s order.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Eldon E. Fallon and Magistrate Judge Michael North. The case was later reassigned to Judge Carl J Barbier.\n\nOn March 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting the court to order Defendant Denka to implement significant pollution controls to reduce chloroprene emissions promptly. The motion emphasized the urgency of protecting the health of the local community. \u200b\n\nIn response, Defendant Denka filed a counterclaim against the Plaintiff. Defendant Denka argued that the Plaintiff\u2019s issuance and application of its 2010 rule, which set the acceptable limits of chloroprene, was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with the law\u201d in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), because the rule makers failed to consider and ignored the best available scientific data, as well as new scientific models, despite concerns raised by qualified peer reviewers. Defendants sought declaratory relief and injunctive relief enjoining Plaintiff from using the 2010 rule until it reconsidered the rule in light of the new evidence.\n\nOn May 2, 2023, Defendant DuPont filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Defendant DuPont argued that it was not involved in any of the alleged harmful activity, nor had Plaintiff identified any actual or immediate current harm that would occur if Defendant DuPont were not included as a Party in this action. The court denied this motion.\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss Defendant Denka's counterclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, Plaintiff argued that Defendant Denka's challenges to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) actions were time-barred and that certain EPA decisions were committed to agency discretion, thus not subject to judicial review. This motion was deemed deficient, and Plaintiff filed this motion again on May 8. It was deemed deficient again. On May 9, Plaintiff filed a third motion to dismiss with the same reasoning as the first. On August 30, 2023, the court granted this motion.\n\nOn October 25, 2023, Defendant Denka filed an amended counterclaim. It was deemed deficient, and Defendant Denka refiled on November 3, 2023. This new counterclaim added new additional allegations and facts about how Plaintiff had disregarded substantial scientific evidence that adopting the 2010 standard as a bright-line rule was not necessary to protect human health or the environment. Shortly after, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the amended counterclaim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe following month, Defendant Denka filed a motion for summary judgment on December 29. In its motion, Defendant emphasized that its chloroprene emissions posed a cancer risk of 5-in-10,000 to a person who breathed in these emissions all day, every day for 70 years. Defendant argued that this risk did not amount to an \u201cimminent and substantial endangerment\u201d warranting the chloroprene emission limitations imposed by the 2010 rule.\n\nThe same day, Defendant DuPont filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court denied the motion in July 2024, as Defendant offered no new grounds to warrant its dismissal from the case beyond those already denied by the Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\nOn May 16, 2024, the EPA published a new rule titled \u201cNew Source Performance Standards for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Group I & II Polymers and Resins Industry\u201d (89 Fed. Reg. 42932). This rule updated and amended existing standards to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants, including chloroprene emissions, from manufacturing facilities. Specifically, the new rule imposed stricter emission standards on facilities that produce or use chloroprene, requiring the application of advanced control technologies to minimize emissions.\n\nThe same day, Defendant Denka filed a petition for review of the new rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, arguing that this new rule was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law (docket no. 24-01135).\n\nOn May 31, the Parties attended a status conference to discuss how the new rule would affect the ongoing litigation, and Defendant Denka proposed to hold the case in abeyance until October 15, to determine whether the new rule would render the current litigation moot. The Parties filed status reports throughout the summer.\n\nMeanwhile, on June 11, several nonprofits (including the Concerned Citizens of St. John, Rise St. James Louisiana, Louisiana Environmental Action Network, Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services, Air Alliance Houston, California Communities Against Toxics, Environmental Defense Fund, Environment Integrity Project, and Sierra Club) filed a motion to intervene in the petition for review of the new EPA rule. This action was granted the following day.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the petition for review was consolidated with another petition for review (docket no. 24-1228). The following week, the court consolidated more cases (24-1249, 24-1250, 24-1251, 24-1252) with 24-1135.\n\nOn September 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to reopen the case. Plaintiff argued that until Defendant Denka complied with the new rule, thousands of Parish residents would continue to be exposed to high levels of chloroprene emissions, exposing them to a higher risk of cancer. Plaintiff further sought a status hearing and to reset the case for trial.\n\nThe court granted in part the motion to reopen the case. The Parties attended a status conference on November 21 to discuss the future of the case.\n\nOn January 10, 2025 granted the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and dismissed the counterclaim with prejudice.\n\nOn March 7, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the case. The Trump administration stated that this decision aligned with efforts to dismantle \"radical Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs\" and ensure unbiased law enforcement (Justice Dept. says ending Louisiana petrochemical case helps \u2018dismantle radical DEI programs\u2019 [https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apnews.com/article/trump-louisiana-cancer-denka-chloroprene-epa-lawsuit-89b1f870816f65370eeb75ff269e9c0e&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1743371953208062&usg=AOvVaw347nD5ij_RdIBBz8L0b3GS]). The case was officially dismissed on March 10.\n\nThis case is now closed.",

    "target": "This case challenges the carcinogenic chloroprene emissions from Denka Performance Elastomer, LLC\u2019s (Denka\u2019s) neoprene manufacturing facility at the Pontchartrain Works Site in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana, as being unacceptably high under EPA regulations. Denka's facility produced neoprene, a synthetic rubber, emitting chloroprene\u2014a chemical classified by the EPA in 2010 as likely carcinogenic to humans. Air monitoring near the facility reportedly detected chloroprene concentrations up to 14 times the EPA's recommended levels, posing a risk to the majority-Black population surrounding the facility.\n\nOn February 28, 2023, the United States government filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Plaintiff sued Denka Performance Elastomer LLC, the owner and operator of a neoprene manufacturing facility, and DuPont Specialty Products, the owner of the land on which the neoprene manufacturing facility was located and leased to Defendant Denka. Plaintiff sued Defendant Denka under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7603, alleging that Defendant Denka's chloroprene emissions from its neoprene manufacturing facility in LaPlace, Louisiana, posed an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health across communities in St. John the Baptist Parish. \u200bPlaintiff sued Defendant DuPont under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a) and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, as Defendant Denka may need permission or cooperation from Defendant DuPont to take the necessary actions to abate the imminent and substantial endangerment posed by its current chloroprene emissions.\n\nPlaintiff sought injunctive relief requiring that Defendant Denka immediately reduce its chloroprene emissions to levels that no longer cause or contribute to unacceptably high cancer risks within the communities surrounding the facility. Plaintiff also sought an injunctive relief ordering Defendant DuPont to authorize and not impede construction and necessary measures for Defendant Denka to comply with the court\u2019s order.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Eldon E. Fallon and Magistrate Judge Michael North. The case was later reassigned to Judge Carl J Barbier.\n\nOn March 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting the court to order Defendant Denka to implement significant pollution controls to reduce chloroprene emissions promptly. The motion emphasized the urgency of protecting the health of the local community. \u200b\n\nIn response, Defendant Denka filed a counterclaim against the Plaintiff. Defendant Denka argued that the Plaintiff\u2019s issuance and application of its 2010 rule, which set the acceptable limits of chloroprene, was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with the law\u201d in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), because the rule makers failed to consider and ignored the best available scientific data, as well as new scientific models, despite concerns raised by qualified peer reviewers. Defendants sought declaratory relief and injunctive relief enjoining Plaintiff from using the 2010 rule until it reconsidered the rule in light of the new evidence.\n\nOn May 2, 2023, Defendant DuPont filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Defendant DuPont argued that it was not involved in any of the alleged harmful activity, nor had Plaintiff identified any actual or immediate current harm that would occur if Defendant DuPont were not included as a Party in this action. The court denied this motion.\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss Defendant Denka's counterclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, Plaintiff argued that Defendant Denka's challenges to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) actions were time-barred and that certain EPA decisions were committed to agency discretion, thus not subject to judicial review. This motion was deemed deficient, and Plaintiff filed this motion again on May 8. It was deemed deficient again. On May 9, Plaintiff filed a third motion to dismiss with the same reasoning as the first. On August 30, 2023, the court granted this motion.\n\nOn October 25, 2023, Defendant Denka filed an amended counterclaim. It was deemed deficient, and Defendant Denka refiled on November 3, 2023. This new counterclaim added new additional allegations and facts about how Plaintiff had disregarded substantial scientific evidence that adopting the 2010 standard as a bright-line rule was not necessary to protect human health or the environment. Shortly after, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the amended counterclaim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe following month, Defendant Denka filed a motion for summary judgment on December 29. In its motion, Defendant emphasized that its chloroprene emissions posed a cancer risk of 5-in-10,000 to a person who breathed in these emissions all day, every day for 70 years. Defendant argued that this risk did not amount to an \u201cimminent and substantial endangerment\u201d warranting the chloroprene emission limitations imposed by the 2010 rule.\n\nThe same day, Defendant DuPont filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court denied the motion in July 2024, as Defendant offered no new grounds to warrant its dismissal from the case beyond those already denied by the Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\nOn May 16, 2024, the EPA published a new rule titled \u201cNew Source Performance Standards for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Group I & II Polymers and Resins Industry\u201d (89 Fed. Reg. 42932). This rule updated and amended existing standards to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants, including chloroprene emissions, from manufacturing facilities. Specifically, the new rule imposed stricter emission standards on facilities that produce or use chloroprene, requiring the application of advanced control technologies to minimize emissions.\n\nThe same day, Defendant Denka filed a petition for review of the new rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, arguing that this new rule was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law (docket no. 24-01135).\n\nOn May 31, the Parties attended a status conference to discuss how the new rule would affect the ongoing litigation, and Defendant Denka proposed to hold the case in abeyance until October 15, to determine whether the new rule would render the current litigation moot. The Parties filed status reports throughout the summer.\n\nMeanwhile, on June 11, several nonprofits (including the Concerned Citizens of St. John, Rise St. James Louisiana, Louisiana Environmental Action Network, Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services, Air Alliance Houston, California Communities Against Toxics, Environmental Defense Fund, Environment Integrity Project, and Sierra Club) filed a motion to intervene in the petition for review of the new EPA rule. This action was granted the following day.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the petition for review was consolidated with another petition for review (docket no. 24-1228). The following week, the court consolidated more cases (24-1249, 24-1250, 24-1251, 24-1252) with 24-1135.\n\nOn September 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to reopen the case. Plaintiff argued that until Defendant Denka complied with the new rule, thousands of Parish residents would continue to be exposed to high levels of chloroprene emissions, exposing them to a higher risk of cancer. Plaintiff further sought a status hearing and to reset the case for trial.\n\nThe court granted in part the motion to reopen the case. The Parties attended a status conference on November 21 to discuss the future of the case.\n\nOn January 10, 2025 granted the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and dismissed the counterclaim with prejudice.\n\nOn March 7, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the case. The Trump administration stated that this decision aligned with efforts to dismantle \"radical Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs\" and ensure unbiased law enforcement (Justice Dept. says ending Louisiana petrochemical case helps \u2018dismantle radical DEI programs\u2019 [https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apnews.com/article/trump-louisiana-cancer-denka-chloroprene-epa-lawsuit-89b1f870816f65370eeb75ff269e9c0e&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1743371953208062&usg=AOvVaw347nD5ij_RdIBBz8L0b3GS]). The case was officially dismissed on March 10.\n\nThis case is now closed.",

    "target": "This case challenges the carcinogenic chloroprene emissions from Denka Performance Elastomer, LLC\u2019s (Denka\u2019s) neoprene manufacturing facility at the Pontchartrain Works Site in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana, as being unacceptably high under EPA regulations. Denka's facility produced neoprene, a synthetic rubber, emitting chloroprene\u2014a chemical classified by the EPA in 2010 as likely carcinogenic to humans. Air monitoring near the facility reportedly detected chloroprene concentrations up to 14 times the EPA's recommended levels, posing a risk to the majority-Black population surrounding the facility.\n\nOn February 28, 2023, the United States government filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Plaintiff sued Denka Performance Elastomer LLC, the owner and operator of a neoprene manufacturing facility, and DuPont Specialty Products, the owner of the land on which the neoprene manufacturing facility was located and leased to Defendant Denka. Plaintiff sued Defendant Denka under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7603, alleging that Defendant Denka's chloroprene emissions from its neoprene manufacturing facility in LaPlace, Louisiana, posed an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health across communities in St. John the Baptist Parish. \u200bPlaintiff sued Defendant DuPont under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a) and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, as Defendant Denka may need permission or cooperation from Defendant DuPont to take the necessary actions to abate the imminent and substantial endangerment posed by its current chloroprene emissions.\n\nPlaintiff sought injunctive relief requiring that Defendant Denka immediately reduce its chloroprene emissions to levels that no longer cause or contribute to unacceptably high cancer risks within the communities surrounding the facility. Plaintiff also sought an injunctive relief ordering Defendant DuPont to authorize and not impede construction and necessary measures for Defendant Denka to comply with the court\u2019s order.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Eldon E. Fallon and Magistrate Judge Michael North. The case was later reassigned to Judge Carl J Barbier.\n\nOn March 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting the court to order Defendant Denka to implement significant pollution controls to reduce chloroprene emissions promptly. The motion emphasized the urgency of protecting the health of the local community. \u200b\n\nIn response, Defendant Denka filed a counterclaim against the Plaintiff. Defendant Denka argued that the Plaintiff\u2019s issuance and application of its 2010 rule, which set the acceptable limits of chloroprene, was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with the law\u201d in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), because the rule makers failed to consider and ignored the best available scientific data, as well as new scientific models, despite concerns raised by qualified peer reviewers. Defendants sought declaratory relief and injunctive relief enjoining Plaintiff from using the 2010 rule until it reconsidered the rule in light of the new evidence.\n\nOn May 2, 2023, Defendant DuPont filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Defendant DuPont argued that it was not involved in any of the alleged harmful activity, nor had Plaintiff identified any actual or immediate current harm that would occur if Defendant DuPont were not included as a Party in this action. The court denied this motion.\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss Defendant Denka's counterclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, Plaintiff argued that Defendant Denka's challenges to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) actions were time-barred and that certain EPA decisions were committed to agency discretion, thus not subject to judicial review. This motion was deemed deficient, and Plaintiff filed this motion again on May 8. It was deemed deficient again. On May 9, Plaintiff filed a third motion to dismiss with the same reasoning as the first. On August 30, 2023, the court granted this motion.\n\nOn October 25, 2023, Defendant Denka filed an amended counterclaim. It was deemed deficient, and Defendant Denka refiled on November 3, 2023. This new counterclaim added new additional allegations and facts about how Plaintiff had disregarded substantial scientific evidence that adopting the 2010 standard as a bright-line rule was not necessary to protect human health or the environment. Shortly after, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the amended counterclaim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe following month, Defendant Denka filed a motion for summary judgment on December 29. In its motion, Defendant emphasized that its chloroprene emissions posed a cancer risk of 5-in-10,000 to a person who breathed in these emissions all day, every day for 70 years. Defendant argued that this risk did not amount to an \u201cimminent and substantial endangerment\u201d warranting the chloroprene emission limitations imposed by the 2010 rule.\n\nThe same day, Defendant DuPont filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court denied the motion in July 2024, as Defendant offered no new grounds to warrant its dismissal from the case beyond those already denied by the Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\nOn May 16, 2024, the EPA published a new rule titled \u201cNew Source Performance Standards for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Group I & II Polymers and Resins Industry\u201d (89 Fed. Reg. 42932). This rule updated and amended existing standards to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants, including chloroprene emissions, from manufacturing facilities. Specifically, the new rule imposed stricter emission standards on facilities that produce or use chloroprene, requiring the application of advanced control technologies to minimize emissions.\n\nThe same day, Defendant Denka filed a petition for review of the new rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, arguing that this new rule was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law (docket no. 24-01135).\n\nOn May 31, the Parties attended a status conference to discuss how the new rule would affect the ongoing litigation, and Defendant Denka proposed to hold the case in abeyance until October 15, to determine whether the new rule would render the current litigation moot. The Parties filed status reports throughout the summer.\n\nMeanwhile, on June 11, several nonprofits (including the Concerned Citizens of St. John, Rise St. James Louisiana, Louisiana Environmental Action Network, Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services, Air Alliance Houston, California Communities Against Toxics, Environmental Defense Fund, Environment Integrity Project, and Sierra Club) filed a motion to intervene in the petition for review of the new EPA rule. This action was granted the following day.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the petition for review was consolidated with another petition for review (docket no. 24-1228). The following week, the court consolidated more cases (24-1249, 24-1250, 24-1251, 24-1252) with 24-1135.\n\nOn September 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to reopen the case. Plaintiff argued that until Defendant Denka complied with the new rule, thousands of Parish residents would continue to be exposed to high levels of chloroprene emissions, exposing them to a higher risk of cancer. Plaintiff further sought a status hearing and to reset the case for trial.\n\nThe court granted in part the motion to reopen the case.

P. 19(a) and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, as Defendant Denka may need permission or cooperation from Defendant DuPont to take the necessary actions to abate the imminent and substantial endangerment posed by its current chloroprene emissions.\n\nPlaintiff sought injunctive relief requiring that Defendant Denka immediately reduce its chloroprene emissions to levels that no longer cause or contribute to unacceptably high cancer risks within the communities surrounding the facility. Plaintiff also sought an injunctive relief ordering Defendant DuPont to authorize and not impede construction and necessary measures for Defendant Denka to comply with the court\u2019s order.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Eldon E. Fallon and Magistrate Judge Michael North. The case was later reassigned to Judge Carl J Barbier.\n\nOn March 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting the court to order Defendant Denka to implement significant pollution controls to reduce chloroprene emissions promptly. The motion emphasized the urgency of protecting the health of the local community. \u200b\n\nIn response, Defendant Denka filed a counterclaim against the Plaintiff. Defendant Denka argued that the Plaintiff\u2019s issuance and application of its 2010 rule, which set the acceptable limits of chloroprene, was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with the law\u201d in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), because the rule makers failed to consider and ignored the best available scientific data, as well as new scientific models, despite concerns raised by qualified peer reviewers. Defendants sought declaratory relief and injunctive relief enjoining Plaintiff from using the 2010 rule until it reconsidered the rule in light of the new evidence.\n\nOn May 2, 2023, Defendant DuPont filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Defendant DuPont argued that it was not involved in any of the alleged harmful activity, nor had Plaintiff identified any actual or immediate current harm that would occur if Defendant DuPont were not included as a Party in this action. The court denied this motion.\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss Defendant Denka's counterclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, Plaintiff argued that Defendant Denka's challenges to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) actions were time-barred and that certain EPA decisions were committed to agency discretion, thus not subject to judicial review. This motion was deemed deficient, and Plaintiff filed this motion again on May 8. It was deemed deficient again. On May 9, Plaintiff filed a third motion to dismiss with the same reasoning as the first. On August 30, 2023, the court granted this motion.\n\nOn October 25, 2023, Defendant Denka filed an amended counterclaim. It was deemed deficient, and Defendant Denka refiled on November 3, 2023. This new counterclaim added new additional allegations and facts about how Plaintiff had disregarded substantial scientific evidence that adopting the 2010 standard as a bright-line rule was not necessary to protect human health or the environment. Shortly after, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the amended counterclaim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe following month, Defendant Denka filed a motion for summary judgment on December 29. In its motion, Defendant emphasized that its chloroprene emissions posed a cancer risk of 5-in-10,000 to a person who breathed in these emissions all day, every day for 70 years. Defendant argued that this risk did not amount to an \u201cimminent and substantial endangerment\u201d warranting the chloroprene emission limitations imposed by the 2010 rule.\n\nThe same day, Defendant DuPont filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court denied the motion in July 2024, as Defendant offered no new grounds to warrant its dismissal from the case beyond those already denied by the Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\nOn May 16, 2024, the EPA published a new rule titled \u201cNew Source Performance Standards for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Group I & II Polymers and Resins Industry\u201d (89 Fed. Reg. 42932). This rule updated and amended existing standards to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants, including chloroprene emissions, from manufacturing facilities. Specifically, the new rule imposed stricter emission standards on facilities that produce or use chloroprene, requiring the application of advanced control technologies to minimize emissions.\n\nThe same day, Defendant Denka filed a petition for review of the new rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, arguing that this new rule was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law (docket no. 24-01135).\n\nOn May 31, the Parties attended a status conference to discuss how the new rule would affect the ongoing litigation, and Defendant Denka proposed to hold the case in abeyance until October 15, to determine whether the new rule would render the current litigation moot. The Parties filed status reports throughout the summer.\n\nMeanwhile, on June 11, several nonprofits (including the Concerned Citizens of St. John, Rise St. James Louisiana, Louisiana Environmental Action Network, Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services, Air Alliance Houston, California Communities Against Toxics, Environmental Defense Fund, Environment Integrity Project, and Sierra Club) filed a motion to intervene in the petition for review of the new EPA rule. This action was granted the following day.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the petition for review was consolidated with another petition for review (docket no. 24-1228). The following week, the court consolidated more cases (24-1249, 24-1250, 24-1251, 24-1252) with 24-1135.\n\nOn September 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to reopen the case. Plaintiff argued that until Defendant Denka complied with the new rule, thousands of Parish residents would continue to be exposed to high levels of chloroprene emissions, exposing them to a higher risk of cancer. Plaintiff further sought a status hearing and to reset the case for trial.\n\nThe court granted in part the motion to reopen the case. The Parties attended a status conference on November 21 to discuss the future of the case.\n\nOn January 10, 2025 granted the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and dismissed the counterclaim with prejudice.\n\nOn March 7, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the case. The Trump administration stated that this decision aligned with efforts to dismantle \"radical Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs\" and ensure unbiased law enforcement (Justice Dept. says ending Louisiana petrochemical case helps \u2018dismantle radical DEI programs\u2019 [https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apnews.com/article/trump-louisiana-cancer-denka-chloroprene-epa-lawsuit-89b1f870816f65370eeb75ff269e9c0e&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1743371953208062&usg=AOvVaw347nD5ij_RdIBBz8L0b3GS]).

    "target": "This case challenges the carcinogenic chloroprene emissions from Denka Performance Elastomer, LLC\u2019s (Denka\u2019s) neoprene manufacturing facility at the Pontchartrain Works Site in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana, as being unacceptably high under EPA regulations. Denka's facility produced neoprene, a synthetic rubber, emitting chloroprene\u2014a chemical classified by the EPA in 2010 as likely carcinogenic to humans. Air monitoring near the facility reportedly detected chloroprene concentrations up to 14 times the EPA's recommended levels, posing a risk to the majority-Black population surrounding the facility.\n\nOn February 28, 2023, the United States government filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Plaintiff sued Denka Performance Elastomer LLC, the owner and operator of a neoprene manufacturing facility, and DuPont Specialty Products, the owner of the land on which the neoprene manufacturing facility was located and leased to Defendant Denka. Plaintiff sued Defendant Denka under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7603, alleging that Defendant Denka's chloroprene emissions from its neoprene manufacturing facility in LaPlace, Louisiana, posed an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health across communities in St. John the Baptist Parish. \u200bPlaintiff sued Defendant DuPont under Fed.

    "target": "This case challenges the carcinogenic chloroprene emissions from Denka Performance Elastomer, LLC\u2019s (Denka\u2019s) neoprene manufacturing facility at the Pontchartrain Works Site in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana, as being unacceptably high under EPA regulations. Denka's facility produced neoprene, a synthetic rubber, emitting chloroprene\u2014a chemical classified by the EPA in 2010 as likely carcinogenic to humans. Air monitoring near the facility reportedly detected chloroprene concentrations up to 14 times the EPA's recommended levels, posing a risk to the majority-Black population surrounding the facility.\n\nOn February 28, 2023, the United States government filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Plaintiff sued Denka Performance Elastomer LLC, the owner and operator of a neoprene manufacturing facility, and DuPont Specialty Products, the owner of the land on which the neoprene manufacturing facility was located and leased to Defendant Denka. Plaintiff sued Defendant Denka under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7603, alleging that Defendant Denka's chloroprene emissions from its neoprene manufacturing facility in LaPlace, Louisiana, posed an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health across communities in St. John the Baptist Parish. \u200bPlaintiff sued Defendant DuPont under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a) and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, as Defendant Denka may need permission or cooperation from Defendant DuPont to take the necessary actions to abate the imminent and substantial endangerment posed by its current chloroprene emissions.\n\nPlaintiff sought injunctive relief requiring that Defendant Denka immediately reduce its chloroprene emissions to levels that no longer cause or contribute to unacceptably high cancer risks within the communities surrounding the facility. Plaintiff also sought an injunctive relief ordering Defendant DuPont to authorize and not impede construction and necessary measures for Defendant Denka to comply with the court\u2019s order.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Eldon E. Fallon and Magistrate Judge Michael North. The case was later reassigned to Judge Carl J Barbier.\n\nOn March 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting the court to order Defendant Denka to implement significant pollution controls to reduce chloroprene emissions promptly. The motion emphasized the urgency of protecting the health of the local community. \u200b\n\nIn response, Defendant Denka filed a counterclaim against the Plaintiff. Defendant Denka argued that the Plaintiff\u2019s issuance and application of its 2010 rule, which set the acceptable limits of chloroprene, was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with the law\u201d in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), because the rule makers failed to consider and ignored the best available scientific data, as well as new scientific models, despite concerns raised by qualified peer reviewers. Defendants sought declaratory relief and injunctive relief enjoining Plaintiff from using the 2010 rule until it reconsidered the rule in light of the new evidence.\n\nOn May 2, 2023, Defendant DuPont filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Defendant DuPont argued that it was not involved in any of the alleged harmful activity, nor had Plaintiff identified any actual or immediate current harm that would occur if Defendant DuPont were not included as a Party in this action. The court denied this motion.\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss Defendant Denka's counterclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, Plaintiff argued that Defendant Denka's challenges to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) actions were time-barred and that certain EPA decisions were committed to agency discretion, thus not subject to judicial review. This motion was deemed deficient, and Plaintiff filed this motion again on May 8. It was deemed deficient again. On May 9, Plaintiff filed a third motion to dismiss with the same reasoning as the first. On August 30, 2023, the court granted this motion.\n\nOn October 25, 2023, Defendant Denka filed an amended counterclaim. It was deemed deficient, and Defendant Denka refiled on November 3, 2023. This new counterclaim added new additional allegations and facts about how Plaintiff had disregarded substantial scientific evidence that adopting the 2010 standard as a bright-line rule was not necessary to protect human health or the environment. Shortly after, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the amended counterclaim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe following month, Defendant Denka filed a motion for summary judgment on December 29. In its motion, Defendant emphasized that its chloroprene emissions posed a cancer risk of 5-in-10,000 to a person who breathed in these emissions all day, every day for 70 years. Defendant argued that this risk did not amount to an \u201cimminent and substantial endangerment\u201d warranting the chloroprene emission limitations imposed by the 2010 rule.\n\nThe same day, Defendant DuPont filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court denied the motion in July 2024, as Defendant offered no new grounds to warrant its dismissal from the case beyond those already denied by the Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\nOn May 16, 2024, the EPA published a new rule titled \u201cNew Source Performance Standards for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Group I & II Polymers and Resins Industry\u201d (89 Fed. Reg. 42932). This rule updated and amended existing standards to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants, including chloroprene emissions, from manufacturing facilities. Specifically, the new rule imposed stricter emission standards on facilities that produce or use chloroprene, requiring the application of advanced control technologies to minimize emissions.\n\nThe same day, Defendant Denka filed a petition for review of the new rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, arguing that this new rule was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law (docket no. 24-01135).\n\nOn May 31, the Parties attended a status conference to discuss how the new rule would affect the ongoing litigation, and Defendant Denka proposed to hold the case in abeyance until October 15, to determine whether the new rule would render the current litigation moot. The Parties filed status reports throughout the summer.\n\nMeanwhile, on June 11, several nonprofits (including the Concerned Citizens of St. John, Rise St. James Louisiana, Louisiana Environmental Action Network, Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services, Air Alliance Houston, California Communities Against Toxics, Environmental Defense Fund, Environment Integrity Project, and Sierra Club) filed a motion to intervene in the petition for review of the new EPA rule. This action was granted the following day.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the petition for review was consolidated with another petition for review (docket no. 24-1228). The following week, the court consolidated more cases (24-1249, 24-1250, 24-1251, 24-1252) with 24-1135.\n\nOn September 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to reopen the case. Plaintiff argued that until Defendant Denka complied with the new rule, thousands of Parish residents would continue to be exposed to high levels of chloroprene emissions, exposing them to a higher risk of cancer. Plaintiff further sought a status hearing and to reset the case for trial.\n\nThe court granted in part the motion to reopen the case. The Parties attended a status conference on November 21 to discuss the future of the case.\n\nOn January 10, 2025 granted the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and dismissed the counterclaim with prejudice.\n\nOn March 7, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the case. The Trump administration stated that this decision aligned with efforts to dismantle \"radical Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs\" and ensure unbiased law enforcement (Justice Dept. says ending Louisiana petrochemical case helps \u2018dismantle radical DEI programs\u2019 [https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apnews.com/article/trump-louisiana-cancer-denka-chloroprene-epa-lawsuit-89b1f870816f65370eeb75ff269e9c0e&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1743371953208062&usg=AOvVaw347nD5ij_RdIBBz8L0b3GS]).

Defendant argued that this risk did not amount to an \u201cimminent and substantial endangerment\u201d warranting the chloroprene emission limitations imposed by the 2010 rule.\n\nThe same day, Defendant DuPont filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court denied the motion in July 2024, as Defendant offered no new grounds to warrant its dismissal from the case beyond those already denied by the Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\nOn May 16, 2024, the EPA published a new rule titled \u201cNew Source Performance Standards for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Group I & II Polymers and Resins Industry\u201d (89 Fed. Reg. 42932). This rule updated and amended existing standards to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants, including chloroprene emissions, from manufacturing facilities. Specifically, the new rule imposed stricter emission standards on facilities that produce or use chloroprene, requiring the application of advanced control technologies to minimize emissions.\n\nThe same day, Defendant Denka filed a petition for review of the new rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, arguing that this new rule was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law (docket no. 24-01135).\n\nOn May 31, the Parties attended a status conference to discuss how the new rule would affect the ongoing litigation, and Defendant Denka proposed to hold the case in abeyance until October 15, to determine whether the new rule would render the current litigation moot. The Parties filed status reports throughout the summer.\n\nMeanwhile, on June 11, several nonprofits (including the Concerned Citizens of St. John, Rise St. James Louisiana, Louisiana Environmental Action Network, Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services, Air Alliance Houston, California Communities Against Toxics, Environmental Defense Fund, Environment Integrity Project, and Sierra Club) filed a motion to intervene in the petition for review of the new EPA rule. This action was granted the following day.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the petition for review was consolidated with another petition for review (docket no. 24-1228). The following week, the court consolidated more cases (24-1249, 24-1250, 24-1251, 24-1252) with 24-1135.\n\nOn September 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to reopen the case. Plaintiff argued that until Defendant Denka complied with the new rule, thousands of Parish residents would continue to be exposed to high levels of chloroprene emissions, exposing them to a higher risk of cancer. Plaintiff further sought a status hearing and to reset the case for trial.\n\nThe court granted in part the motion to reopen the case. The Parties attended a status conference on November 21 to discuss the future of the case.\n\nOn January 10, 2025 granted the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and dismissed the counterclaim with prejudice.\n\nOn March 7, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the case. The Trump administration stated that this decision aligned with efforts to dismantle \"radical Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs\" and ensure unbiased law enforcement (Justice Dept. says ending Louisiana petrochemical case helps \u2018dismantle radical DEI programs\u2019 [https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apnews.com/article/trump-louisiana-cancer-denka-chloroprene-epa-lawsuit-89b1f870816f65370eeb75ff269e9c0e&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1743371953208062&usg=AOvVaw347nD5ij_RdIBBz8L0b3GS]).

    "target": "This case challenges the carcinogenic chloroprene emissions from Denka Performance Elastomer, LLC\u2019s (Denka\u2019s) neoprene manufacturing facility at the Pontchartrain Works Site in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana, as being unacceptably high under EPA regulations. Denka's facility produced neoprene, a synthetic rubber, emitting chloroprene\u2014a chemical classified by the EPA in 2010 as likely carcinogenic to humans. Air monitoring near the facility reportedly detected chloroprene concentrations up to 14 times the EPA's recommended levels, posing a risk to the majority-Black population surrounding the facility.\n\nOn February 28, 2023, the United States government filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Plaintiff sued Denka Performance Elastomer LLC, the owner and operator of a neoprene manufacturing facility, and DuPont Specialty Products, the owner of the land on which the neoprene manufacturing facility was located and leased to Defendant Denka. Plaintiff sued Defendant Denka under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7603, alleging that Defendant Denka's chloroprene emissions from its neoprene manufacturing facility in LaPlace, Louisiana, posed an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health across communities in St. John the Baptist Parish. \u200bPlaintiff sued Defendant DuPont under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a) and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, as Defendant Denka may need permission or cooperation from Defendant DuPont to take the necessary actions to abate the imminent and substantial endangerment posed by its current chloroprene emissions.\n\nPlaintiff sought injunctive relief requiring that Defendant Denka immediately reduce its chloroprene emissions to levels that no longer cause or contribute to unacceptably high cancer risks within the communities surrounding the facility. Plaintiff also sought an injunctive relief ordering Defendant DuPont to authorize and not impede construction and necessary measures for Defendant Denka to comply with the court\u2019s order.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Eldon E. Fallon and Magistrate Judge Michael North. The case was later reassigned to Judge Carl J Barbier.\n\nOn March 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting the court to order Defendant Denka to implement significant pollution controls to reduce chloroprene emissions promptly. The motion emphasized the urgency of protecting the health of the local community. \u200b\n\nIn response, Defendant Denka filed a counterclaim against the Plaintiff. Defendant Denka argued that the Plaintiff\u2019s issuance and application of its 2010 rule, which set the acceptable limits of chloroprene, was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with the law\u201d in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), because the rule makers failed to consider and ignored the best available scientific data, as well as new scientific models, despite concerns raised by qualified peer reviewers. Defendants sought declaratory relief and injunctive relief enjoining Plaintiff from using the 2010 rule until it reconsidered the rule in light of the new evidence.\n\nOn May 2, 2023, Defendant DuPont filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Defendant DuPont argued that it was not involved in any of the alleged harmful activity, nor had Plaintiff identified any actual or immediate current harm that would occur if Defendant DuPont were not included as a Party in this action. The court denied this motion.\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss Defendant Denka's counterclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, Plaintiff argued that Defendant Denka's challenges to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) actions were time-barred and that certain EPA decisions were committed to agency discretion, thus not subject to judicial review. This motion was deemed deficient, and Plaintiff filed this motion again on May 8. It was deemed deficient again. On May 9, Plaintiff filed a third motion to dismiss with the same reasoning as the first. On August 30, 2023, the court granted this motion.\n\nOn October 25, 2023, Defendant Denka filed an amended counterclaim. It was deemed deficient, and Defendant Denka refiled on November 3, 2023. This new counterclaim added new additional allegations and facts about how Plaintiff had disregarded substantial scientific evidence that adopting the 2010 standard as a bright-line rule was not necessary to protect human health or the environment. Shortly after, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the amended counterclaim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe following month, Defendant Denka filed a motion for summary judgment on December 29. In its motion, Defendant emphasized that its chloroprene emissions posed a cancer risk of 5-in-10,000 to a person who breathed in these emissions all day, every day for 70 years.

Specifically, the new rule imposed stricter emission standards on facilities that produce or use chloroprene, requiring the application of advanced control technologies to minimize emissions.\n\nThe same day, Defendant Denka filed a petition for review of the new rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, arguing that this new rule was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law (docket no. 24-01135).\n\nOn May 31, the Parties attended a status conference to discuss how the new rule would affect the ongoing litigation, and Defendant Denka proposed to hold the case in abeyance until October 15, to determine whether the new rule would render the current litigation moot. The Parties filed status reports throughout the summer.\n\nMeanwhile, on June 11, several nonprofits (including the Concerned Citizens of St. John, Rise St. James Louisiana, Louisiana Environmental Action Network, Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services, Air Alliance Houston, California Communities Against Toxics, Environmental Defense Fund, Environment Integrity Project, and Sierra Club) filed a motion to intervene in the petition for review of the new EPA rule. This action was granted the following day.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the petition for review was consolidated with another petition for review (docket no. 24-1228). The following week, the court consolidated more cases (24-1249, 24-1250, 24-1251, 24-1252) with 24-1135.\n\nOn September 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to reopen the case. Plaintiff argued that until Defendant Denka complied with the new rule, thousands of Parish residents would continue to be exposed to high levels of chloroprene emissions, exposing them to a higher risk of cancer. Plaintiff further sought a status hearing and to reset the case for trial.\n\nThe court granted in part the motion to reopen the case. The Parties attended a status conference on November 21 to discuss the future of the case.\n\nOn January 10, 2025 granted the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and dismissed the counterclaim with prejudice.\n\nOn March 7, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the case. The Trump administration stated that this decision aligned with efforts to dismantle \"radical Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs\" and ensure unbiased law enforcement (Justice Dept. says ending Louisiana petrochemical case helps \u2018dismantle radical DEI programs\u2019 [https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apnews.com/article/trump-louisiana-cancer-denka-chloroprene-epa-lawsuit-89b1f870816f65370eeb75ff269e9c0e&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1743371953208062&usg=AOvVaw347nD5ij_RdIBBz8L0b3GS]).

    "target": "This case challenges the carcinogenic chloroprene emissions from Denka Performance Elastomer, LLC\u2019s (Denka\u2019s) neoprene manufacturing facility at the Pontchartrain Works Site in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana, as being unacceptably high under EPA regulations. Denka's facility produced neoprene, a synthetic rubber, emitting chloroprene\u2014a chemical classified by the EPA in 2010 as likely carcinogenic to humans. Air monitoring near the facility reportedly detected chloroprene concentrations up to 14 times the EPA's recommended levels, posing a risk to the majority-Black population surrounding the facility.\n\nOn February 28, 2023, the United States government filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Plaintiff sued Denka Performance Elastomer LLC, the owner and operator of a neoprene manufacturing facility, and DuPont Specialty Products, the owner of the land on which the neoprene manufacturing facility was located and leased to Defendant Denka. Plaintiff sued Defendant Denka under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7603, alleging that Defendant Denka's chloroprene emissions from its neoprene manufacturing facility in LaPlace, Louisiana, posed an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health across communities in St. John the Baptist Parish. \u200bPlaintiff sued Defendant DuPont under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a) and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, as Defendant Denka may need permission or cooperation from Defendant DuPont to take the necessary actions to abate the imminent and substantial endangerment posed by its current chloroprene emissions.\n\nPlaintiff sought injunctive relief requiring that Defendant Denka immediately reduce its chloroprene emissions to levels that no longer cause or contribute to unacceptably high cancer risks within the communities surrounding the facility. Plaintiff also sought an injunctive relief ordering Defendant DuPont to authorize and not impede construction and necessary measures for Defendant Denka to comply with the court\u2019s order.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Eldon E. Fallon and Magistrate Judge Michael North. The case was later reassigned to Judge Carl J Barbier.\n\nOn March 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting the court to order Defendant Denka to implement significant pollution controls to reduce chloroprene emissions promptly. The motion emphasized the urgency of protecting the health of the local community. \u200b\n\nIn response, Defendant Denka filed a counterclaim against the Plaintiff. Defendant Denka argued that the Plaintiff\u2019s issuance and application of its 2010 rule, which set the acceptable limits of chloroprene, was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with the law\u201d in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), because the rule makers failed to consider and ignored the best available scientific data, as well as new scientific models, despite concerns raised by qualified peer reviewers. Defendants sought declaratory relief and injunctive relief enjoining Plaintiff from using the 2010 rule until it reconsidered the rule in light of the new evidence.\n\nOn May 2, 2023, Defendant DuPont filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Defendant DuPont argued that it was not involved in any of the alleged harmful activity, nor had Plaintiff identified any actual or immediate current harm that would occur if Defendant DuPont were not included as a Party in this action. The court denied this motion.\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss Defendant Denka's counterclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, Plaintiff argued that Defendant Denka's challenges to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) actions were time-barred and that certain EPA decisions were committed to agency discretion, thus not subject to judicial review. This motion was deemed deficient, and Plaintiff filed this motion again on May 8. It was deemed deficient again. On May 9, Plaintiff filed a third motion to dismiss with the same reasoning as the first. On August 30, 2023, the court granted this motion.\n\nOn October 25, 2023, Defendant Denka filed an amended counterclaim. It was deemed deficient, and Defendant Denka refiled on November 3, 2023. This new counterclaim added new additional allegations and facts about how Plaintiff had disregarded substantial scientific evidence that adopting the 2010 standard as a bright-line rule was not necessary to protect human health or the environment. Shortly after, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the amended counterclaim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe following month, Defendant Denka filed a motion for summary judgment on December 29. In its motion, Defendant emphasized that its chloroprene emissions posed a cancer risk of 5-in-10,000 to a person who breathed in these emissions all day, every day for 70 years. Defendant argued that this risk did not amount to an \u201cimminent and substantial endangerment\u201d warranting the chloroprene emission limitations imposed by the 2010 rule.\n\nThe same day, Defendant DuPont filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court denied the motion in July 2024, as Defendant offered no new grounds to warrant its dismissal from the case beyond those already denied by the Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\nOn May 16, 2024, the EPA published a new rule titled \u201cNew Source Performance Standards for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Group I & II Polymers and Resins Industry\u201d (89 Fed.

The case was later reassigned to Judge Carl J Barbier.\n\nOn March 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting the court to order Defendant Denka to implement significant pollution controls to reduce chloroprene emissions promptly. The motion emphasized the urgency of protecting the health of the local community. \u200b\n\nIn response, Defendant Denka filed a counterclaim against the Plaintiff. Defendant Denka argued that the Plaintiff\u2019s issuance and application of its 2010 rule, which set the acceptable limits of chloroprene, was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with the law\u201d in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), because the rule makers failed to consider and ignored the best available scientific data, as well as new scientific models, despite concerns raised by qualified peer reviewers. Defendants sought declaratory relief and injunctive relief enjoining Plaintiff from using the 2010 rule until it reconsidered the rule in light of the new evidence.\n\nOn May 2, 2023, Defendant DuPont filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Defendant DuPont argued that it was not involved in any of the alleged harmful activity, nor had Plaintiff identified any actual or immediate current harm that would occur if Defendant DuPont were not included as a Party in this action. The court denied this motion.\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss Defendant Denka's counterclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, Plaintiff argued that Defendant Denka's challenges to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) actions were time-barred and that certain EPA decisions were committed to agency discretion, thus not subject to judicial review. This motion was deemed deficient, and Plaintiff filed this motion again on May 8. It was deemed deficient again. On May 9, Plaintiff filed a third motion to dismiss with the same reasoning as the first. On August 30, 2023, the court granted this motion.\n\nOn October 25, 2023, Defendant Denka filed an amended counterclaim. It was deemed deficient, and Defendant Denka refiled on November 3, 2023. This new counterclaim added new additional allegations and facts about how Plaintiff had disregarded substantial scientific evidence that adopting the 2010 standard as a bright-line rule was not necessary to protect human health or the environment. Shortly after, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the amended counterclaim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe following month, Defendant Denka filed a motion for summary judgment on December 29. In its motion, Defendant emphasized that its chloroprene emissions posed a cancer risk of 5-in-10,000 to a person who breathed in these emissions all day, every day for 70 years. Defendant argued that this risk did not amount to an \u201cimminent and substantial endangerment\u201d warranting the chloroprene emission limitations imposed by the 2010 rule.\n\nThe same day, Defendant DuPont filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court denied the motion in July 2024, as Defendant offered no new grounds to warrant its dismissal from the case beyond those already denied by the Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\nOn May 16, 2024, the EPA published a new rule titled \u201cNew Source Performance Standards for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Group I & II Polymers and Resins Industry\u201d (89 Fed. Reg. 42932). This rule updated and amended existing standards to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants, including chloroprene emissions, from manufacturing facilities. Specifically, the new rule imposed stricter emission standards on facilities that produce or use chloroprene, requiring the application of advanced control technologies to minimize emissions.\n\nThe same day, Defendant Denka filed a petition for review of the new rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, arguing that this new rule was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law (docket no. 24-01135).\n\nOn May 31, the Parties attended a status conference to discuss how the new rule would affect the ongoing litigation, and Defendant Denka proposed to hold the case in abeyance until October 15, to determine whether the new rule would render the current litigation moot. The Parties filed status reports throughout the summer.\n\nMeanwhile, on June 11, several nonprofits (including the Concerned Citizens of St. John, Rise St. James Louisiana, Louisiana Environmental Action Network, Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services, Air Alliance Houston, California Communities Against Toxics, Environmental Defense Fund, Environment Integrity Project, and Sierra Club) filed a motion to intervene in the petition for review of the new EPA rule. This action was granted the following day.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the petition for review was consolidated with another petition for review (docket no. 24-1228). The following week, the court consolidated more cases (24-1249, 24-1250, 24-1251, 24-1252) with 24-1135.\n\nOn September 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to reopen the case. Plaintiff argued that until Defendant Denka complied with the new rule, thousands of Parish residents would continue to be exposed to high levels of chloroprene emissions, exposing them to a higher risk of cancer. Plaintiff further sought a status hearing and to reset the case for trial.\n\nThe court granted in part the motion to reopen the case. The Parties attended a status conference on November 21 to discuss the future of the case.\n\nOn January 10, 2025 granted the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and dismissed the counterclaim with prejudice.\n\nOn March 7, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the case.

    "target": "This case challenges the carcinogenic chloroprene emissions from Denka Performance Elastomer, LLC\u2019s (Denka\u2019s) neoprene manufacturing facility at the Pontchartrain Works Site in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana, as being unacceptably high under EPA regulations. Denka's facility produced neoprene, a synthetic rubber, emitting chloroprene\u2014a chemical classified by the EPA in 2010 as likely carcinogenic to humans. Air monitoring near the facility reportedly detected chloroprene concentrations up to 14 times the EPA's recommended levels, posing a risk to the majority-Black population surrounding the facility.\n\nOn February 28, 2023, the United States government filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Plaintiff sued Denka Performance Elastomer LLC, the owner and operator of a neoprene manufacturing facility, and DuPont Specialty Products, the owner of the land on which the neoprene manufacturing facility was located and leased to Defendant Denka. Plaintiff sued Defendant Denka under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7603, alleging that Defendant Denka's chloroprene emissions from its neoprene manufacturing facility in LaPlace, Louisiana, posed an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health across communities in St. John the Baptist Parish. \u200bPlaintiff sued Defendant DuPont under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a) and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, as Defendant Denka may need permission or cooperation from Defendant DuPont to take the necessary actions to abate the imminent and substantial endangerment posed by its current chloroprene emissions.\n\nPlaintiff sought injunctive relief requiring that Defendant Denka immediately reduce its chloroprene emissions to levels that no longer cause or contribute to unacceptably high cancer risks within the communities surrounding the facility.
