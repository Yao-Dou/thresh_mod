    "target": "This case challenged the Trump Administration's authority to suspend federal funding to states because they continue to permit transgender girls and women to participate in women's school sports. On April 7, 2025, the state of Maine filed this lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine. On April 2, 2025, the Department of Agriculture froze funds allocated to Maine to feed schoolchildren because the federal government had determined that Maine was violating Title IX by continuing to permit transgender girls to participate in girls' school sports. Represented by the Maine Attorney General, the plaintiff alleged that the funding freeze violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). The plaintiff asked the court to vacate and set aside the funding freeze and sought preliminary and permanent injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge John A. Woodcock.\n\nThe plaintiff filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) concurrently with the complaint. Judge Woodcock held a hearing on the TRO motion on April 8 and set a briefing schedule to conclude by April 10. Also on April 8, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with slightly more detailed factual allegations and a statement of verification by the Assistant Attorney General of Maine.\n\nOn April 9, the court issued an order asking the parties to submit briefings regarding the court's jurisdiction. The court cited a recent Supreme Court opinion in a similar case, [../../../../case/46201/] suggesting that under the Tucker Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491), jurisdiction for suits based on \"any express or implied contract with the United States\" lies in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Judge Woodcock asked the parties to address whether the District of Maine had jurisdiction, whether the Tucker Act provided exclusive jurisdiction in the Claims Court, and whether the Supreme Court's recent holding was distinguishable from this case.\n\nThe Court issued a TRO on April 11 ordering the defendant to unfreeze and release the frozen funds during the pendency of the TRO. On April 15, the parties filed a joint motion to extend the TRO past its 14 day term to May 9, 2025. Following a hearing on April 15, the court granted the extension motion and ordered the parties to propose a hearing date for the forthcoming preliminary injunction (\"PI\") motion by May 2.\n\nThe case then settled; according to press reports [https://www.foxnews.com/sports/maine-drops-trans-athlete-lawsuit-against-trump-administration-after-states-federal-funding-restored], USDA restored the challenged funding, and in exchange, Maine withdrew the lawsuit on May 2.\n\nThis case is closed.",

    "target": "This case challenged the Trump Administration's authority to suspend federal funding to states because they continue to permit transgender girls and women to participate in women's school sports. On April 7, 2025, the state of Maine filed this lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine. On April 2, 2025, the Department of Agriculture froze funds allocated to Maine to feed schoolchildren because the federal government had determined that Maine was violating Title IX by continuing to permit transgender girls to participate in girls' school sports. Represented by the Maine Attorney General, the plaintiff alleged that the funding freeze violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). The plaintiff asked the court to vacate and set aside the funding freeze and sought preliminary and permanent injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge John A. Woodcock.\n\nThe plaintiff filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) concurrently with the complaint. Judge Woodcock held a hearing on the TRO motion on April 8 and set a briefing schedule to conclude by April 10. Also on April 8, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with slightly more detailed factual allegations and a statement of verification by the Assistant Attorney General of Maine.\n\nOn April 9, the court issued an order asking the parties to submit briefings regarding the court's jurisdiction. The court cited a recent Supreme Court opinion in a similar case, [../../../../case/46201/] suggesting that under the Tucker Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491), jurisdiction for suits based on \"any express or implied contract with the United States\" lies in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Judge Woodcock asked the parties to address whether the District of Maine had jurisdiction, whether the Tucker Act provided exclusive jurisdiction in the Claims Court, and whether the Supreme Court's recent holding was distinguishable from this case.\n\nThe Court issued a TRO on April 11 ordering the defendant to unfreeze and release the frozen funds during the pendency of the TRO. On April 15, the parties filed a joint motion to extend the TRO past its 14 day term to May 9, 2025. Following a hearing on April 15, the court granted the extension motion and ordered the parties to propose a hearing date for the forthcoming preliminary injunction (\"PI\") motion by May 2.\n\nThe case then settled; according to press reports [https://www.foxnews.com/sports/maine-drops-trans-athlete-lawsuit-against-trump-administration-after-states-federal-funding-restored], USDA restored the challenged funding, and in exchange, Maine withdrew the lawsuit on May 2.\n\nThis case is closed.",
