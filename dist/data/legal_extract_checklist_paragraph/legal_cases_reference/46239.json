    "target": "This case challenged Trump\u2019s Executive Orders 14151 and 14173, which cut government funding for \u201cequity-related\u201d programs. On March 17, 2025, Erie County, New York, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the Corporation for National and Community Service (commonly known as AmeriCorps) and its interim agency head. The case was assigned to Judge James Emanuel Boasberg. Erie County sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that AmeriCorps\u2019 actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe dispute arose after Erie County applied for and was awarded a three-year Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) grant from AmeriCorps in October 2023. The grant, which supports volunteer services such as the Meals on Wheels program, was approved in January 2024. However, after the issuance of Executive Order 14151 on January 20, 2025\u2014titled \u201cEnding Radical Government DEI Programs and Preferencing\u201d\u2014AmeriCorps began reviewing grant recipients for compliance with the order\u2019s mandate to eliminate \u201cequity-related\u201d programs. The following day, President Trump issued Executive Order 14173, requiring federal grant recipients to certify that they did not operate programs promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) that violated federal antidiscrimination laws. AmeriCorps subsequently demanded that Erie County either amend its grant application, certify its compliance with all administration executive orders, or relinquish the award.\n\nIn February 2025, Erie County received multiple communications from AmeriCorps stating that noncompliance with the executive orders could result in grant termination. In response, the county pointed to a temporary injunction against Executive Order 14151 issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.\u00a0See\u00a0National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education v. Trump [../../../../case/46024/].\u00a0AmeriCorps initially paused enforcement but continued to impose additional conditions on grant applications.\n\nIn its complaint, Erie County claimed that AmeriCorps\u2019 enforcement of the executive orders was arbitrary, capricious, and exceeded its lawful authority under the Administrative Procedure Act. The county also alleged that the vague and undefined requirements of the orders violated the Spending Clause by coercing local governments into compliance with federal conditions that lacked a clear legal basis. Erie County argued that AmeriCorps\u2019 demands were unlawful, as its regulations had long required applicants to promote community diversity in their programs. The county refused to certify that its RSVP program did not promote DEI, noting that it had operated in full compliance with AmeriCorps regulations. The lawsuit sought a court order enjoining AmeriCorps from imposing additional grant requirements beyond those established by law and from enforcing Executive Orders 14151 and 14173 against the county.\n\nOn March 21, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. They asked the Court to require the \"Defendants to determine Plaintiff is in compliance with all relevant grant requirements for existing RSVP grants, and to disburse immediately any funds to which it is entitled, without Plaintiff needing to certify that \u201cRSVP of Erie County, 24SR260017 complies with all administration Executive Orders and does not include any activities that promote DEI activities,\u201d or make any other substantially similar certification referencing compliance with executive orders and promotion of DEI activities.\" The defendants filed their motion in opposition to the preliminary injunction on April 4, 2025, arguing the \"Plaintiff ha[d] not demonstrated that it is at imminent risk of irreparable harm, that it is likely to succeed on the merits, or that the balance of the equities is in its favor.\"\n\nOn April 14, plaintiffs filed a voluntary motion to dismiss the case without prejudice, which the judge granted. They decided to do so after the defendants changed their certification requirement.\u00a0 According to the Erie County website, AmeriCorps withdrew its requirement that the county must certify compliance with Executive Orders 14151 and 14173 or certify that its grants did not \"include any activities that promote DEI activities\u201d (See Erie County Dismisses Lawsuit against Americorps [https://www4.erie.gov/exec/press/erie-county-dismisses-lawsuit-against-americorps-after-agency-agrees-erie-county-can-conduct]). AmeriCorps agreed to issue a grant to Plaintiff using the pre-Trump administration certification.\n\nThis case is closed.",

On March 17, 2025, Erie County, New York, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the Corporation for National and Community Service (commonly known as AmeriCorps) and its interim agency head. The case was assigned to Judge James Emanuel Boasberg. Erie County sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that AmeriCorps\u2019 actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe dispute arose after Erie County applied for and was awarded a three-year Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) grant from AmeriCorps in October 2023. The grant, which supports volunteer services such as the Meals on Wheels program, was approved in January 2024. However, after the issuance of Executive Order 14151 on January 20, 2025\u2014titled \u201cEnding Radical Government DEI Programs and Preferencing\u201d\u2014AmeriCorps began reviewing grant recipients for compliance with the order\u2019s mandate to eliminate \u201cequity-related\u201d programs. The following day, President Trump issued Executive Order 14173, requiring federal grant recipients to certify that they did not operate programs promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) that violated federal antidiscrimination laws. AmeriCorps subsequently demanded that Erie County either amend its grant application, certify its compliance with all administration executive orders, or relinquish the award.\n\nIn February 2025, Erie County received multiple communications from AmeriCorps stating that noncompliance with the executive orders could result in grant termination. In response, the county pointed to a temporary injunction against Executive Order 14151 issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.\u00a0See\u00a0National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education v. Trump [../../../../case/46024/].\u00a0AmeriCorps initially paused enforcement but continued to impose additional conditions on grant applications.\n\nIn its complaint, Erie County claimed that AmeriCorps\u2019 enforcement of the executive orders was arbitrary, capricious, and exceeded its lawful authority under the Administrative Procedure Act. The county also alleged that the vague and undefined requirements of the orders violated the Spending Clause by coercing local governments into compliance with federal conditions that lacked a clear legal basis. Erie County argued that AmeriCorps\u2019 demands were unlawful, as its regulations had long required applicants to promote community diversity in their programs. The county refused to certify that its RSVP program did not promote DEI, noting that it had operated in full compliance with AmeriCorps regulations. The lawsuit sought a court order enjoining AmeriCorps from imposing additional grant requirements beyond those established by law and from enforcing Executive Orders 14151 and 14173 against the county.\n\nOn March 21, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. They asked the Court to require the \"Defendants to determine Plaintiff is in compliance with all relevant grant requirements for existing RSVP grants, and to disburse immediately any funds to which it is entitled, without Plaintiff needing to certify that \u201cRSVP of Erie County, 24SR260017 complies with all administration Executive Orders and does not include any activities that promote DEI activities,\u201d or make any other substantially similar certification referencing compliance with executive orders and promotion of DEI activities.\" The defendants filed their motion in opposition to the preliminary injunction on April 4, 2025, arguing the \"Plaintiff ha[d] not demonstrated that it is at imminent risk of irreparable harm, that it is likely to succeed on the merits, or that the balance of the equities is in its favor.\"\n\nOn April 14, plaintiffs filed a voluntary motion to dismiss the case without prejudice, which the judge granted. They decided to do so after the defendants changed their certification requirement.\u00a0 According to the Erie County website, AmeriCorps withdrew its requirement that the county must certify compliance with Executive Orders 14151 and 14173 or certify that its grants did not \"include any activities that promote DEI activities\u201d (See Erie County Dismisses Lawsuit against Americorps [https://www4.erie.gov/exec/press/erie-county-dismisses-lawsuit-against-americorps-after-agency-agrees-erie-county-can-conduct]).

    "target": "This case challenged Trump\u2019s Executive Orders 14151 and 14173, which cut government funding for \u201cequity-related\u201d programs. On March 17, 2025, Erie County, New York, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the Corporation for National and Community Service (commonly known as AmeriCorps) and its interim agency head. The case was assigned to Judge James Emanuel Boasberg. Erie County sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that AmeriCorps\u2019 actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe dispute arose after Erie County applied for and was awarded a three-year Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) grant from AmeriCorps in October 2023. The grant, which supports volunteer services such as the Meals on Wheels program, was approved in January 2024. However, after the issuance of Executive Order 14151 on January 20, 2025\u2014titled \u201cEnding Radical Government DEI Programs and Preferencing\u201d\u2014AmeriCorps began reviewing grant recipients for compliance with the order\u2019s mandate to eliminate \u201cequity-related\u201d programs. The following day, President Trump issued Executive Order 14173, requiring federal grant recipients to certify that they did not operate programs promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) that violated federal antidiscrimination laws. AmeriCorps subsequently demanded that Erie County either amend its grant application, certify its compliance with all administration executive orders, or relinquish the award.\n\nIn February 2025, Erie County received multiple communications from AmeriCorps stating that noncompliance with the executive orders could result in grant termination. In response, the county pointed to a temporary injunction against Executive Order 14151 issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.\u00a0See\u00a0National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education v. Trump [../../../../case/46024/].\u00a0AmeriCorps initially paused enforcement but continued to impose additional conditions on grant applications.\n\nIn its complaint, Erie County claimed that AmeriCorps\u2019 enforcement of the executive orders was arbitrary, capricious, and exceeded its lawful authority under the Administrative Procedure Act. The county also alleged that the vague and undefined requirements of the orders violated the Spending Clause by coercing local governments into compliance with federal conditions that lacked a clear legal basis. Erie County argued that AmeriCorps\u2019 demands were unlawful, as its regulations had long required applicants to promote community diversity in their programs. The county refused to certify that its RSVP program did not promote DEI, noting that it had operated in full compliance with AmeriCorps regulations. The lawsuit sought a court order enjoining AmeriCorps from imposing additional grant requirements beyond those established by law and from enforcing Executive Orders 14151 and 14173 against the county.\n\nOn March 21, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. They asked the Court to require the \"Defendants to determine Plaintiff is in compliance with all relevant grant requirements for existing RSVP grants, and to disburse immediately any funds to which it is entitled, without Plaintiff needing to certify that \u201cRSVP of Erie County, 24SR260017 complies with all administration Executive Orders and does not include any activities that promote DEI activities,\u201d or make any other substantially similar certification referencing compliance with executive orders and promotion of DEI activities.\" The defendants filed their motion in opposition to the preliminary injunction on April 4, 2025, arguing the \"Plaintiff ha[d] not demonstrated that it is at imminent risk of irreparable harm, that it is likely to succeed on the merits, or that the balance of the equities is in its favor.\"\n\nOn April 14, plaintiffs filed a voluntary motion to dismiss the case without prejudice, which the judge granted. They decided to do so after the defendants changed their certification requirement.\u00a0 According to the Erie County website, AmeriCorps withdrew its requirement that the county must certify compliance with Executive Orders 14151 and 14173 or certify that its grants did not \"include any activities that promote DEI activities\u201d (See Erie County Dismisses Lawsuit against Americorps [https://www4.erie.gov/exec/press/erie-county-dismisses-lawsuit-against-americorps-after-agency-agrees-erie-county-can-conduct]).
