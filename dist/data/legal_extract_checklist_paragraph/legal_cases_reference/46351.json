    "target": "This case raises urgent questions about the scope of presidential authority over trade and the constitutional rights of Indigenous communities living along the U.S.\u2013Canada border. On April 4, 2025, two members of the Blackfeet Nation\u2014Montana State Senator Susan Webber and rancher Jonathan St. Goddard\u2014filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Montana against the United States, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, in her official capacity. Represented by private counsel, plaintiffs challenged a series of executive actions issued by President Donald Trump that imposed tariffs on goods entering from Canada. The plaintiffs argue that the tariffs unlawfully burden commerce and travel essential to Blackfeet citizens and violate longstanding treaty protections and constitutional guarantees.\n\nThe challenged actions include multiple executive orders and proclamations\u2014collectively referred to as the \u201cCanada Orders.\u201d These include: (1) Executive Order 14193 (Feb. 1, 2025), which declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA); (2) Proclamations 10895 and 10896, which levied 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act; and (3) Executive Order 14257 (Apr. 2, 2025), which introduced reciprocal tariffs to counter perceived trade imbalances. Plaintiffs claim these measures, which apply universally without exemptions for Indigenous trade, violate constitutional principles and federal treaties.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert multiple legal theories. First, they argue that the President lacked statutory authority to impose tariffs of this scale and scope. Specifically, they contend that IEEPA does not authorize universal tariffs unrelated to a clear foreign threat and that the Trade Expansion Act's delegation of power under Section 232 cannot justify these broad economic measures. Second, they allege that the executive actions violate the separation of powers by encroaching on Congress\u2019s exclusive authority over foreign commerce under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.\n\nIn addition to constitutional structure, the plaintiffs raise claims under the Due Process Clause. They argue that the tariffs impose arbitrary and sweeping economic burdens without procedural safeguards or individualized assessment. The complaint also references historical protections under the Jay Treaty of 1794, the Treaty of Ghent (1814), and early federal tariff acts that explicitly exempted Indigenous trade from duties. The plaintiffs maintain that these protections remain valid, self-executing treaty rights that predate and override later conflicting executive actions.\n\nTo support their claims, the plaintiffs filed declarations and affidavits documenting the concrete harms caused by the tariffs. These include rising business costs, lost tourism income, and disrupted family and trade relations across the northern border. In particular, Senator Webber emphasized the disproportionate impact on the Blackfeet Nation, whose homelands, commerce, and kinship networks span both sides of the U.S.\u2013Canada border.\n\nPlaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, they asked the Court to declare key portions of the Canada Orders unconstitutional, enjoin their enforcement, and, alternatively, exempt tribally enrolled members or tribal border crossings from the tariffs. They also sought attorneys\u2019 fees and any other relief deemed just and proper.\n\nThis case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Dana L. Christensen. On April 4, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary and permanent injunction. On April 11, they filed an amended complaint adding four additional plaintiffs: Ryan Biederman, Andrea Bocanegra, David Greer, and Lisa Ruelas. On April 14, the government moved to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade and requested a stay of proceedings pending that decision. Plaintiffs opposed both motions, arguing that their constitutional and treaty-based claims require resolution in a federal district court with jurisdiction over constitutional and equitable claims.\n\nOn April 21, 2025, the Montana Farmers Union (MFU) moved the court to intervene as a party-plaintiff.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the court granted the defendants' motion to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade and denied their motion to stay as moot. Plaintiffs immediately appealed the transfer order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and filed a motion in the district court for a preliminary injunction pending appeal. On April 28, plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the transfer order. That same day, the district court denied their request for a preliminary injunction pending appeal.\n\nIn the Court of Appeals, plaintiff-appellants filed a motion for injunctive relief on May 1, 2025. Defendant-appellees filed a motion to dismiss that same day. On May 23, the court denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice and ordered that all appellate proceedings, except for mediation, be stayed pending the district court's ruling on the timely tolling motion filed on April 28, 2025.\n\nOn June 2, the district court denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. Following this, plaintiffs filed a motion to expedite in the Court of Appeals, arguing that the stay previously entered was moot in light of the district court's ruling. They requested that the Court of Appeals set an expedited briefing schedule on the merits of their appeal and grant their fully briefed motion for a preliminary injunction. The motion for an expedited briefing schedule was granted on June 18.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case raises urgent questions about the scope of presidential authority over trade and the constitutional rights of Indigenous communities living along the U.S.\u2013Canada border. On April 4, 2025, two members of the Blackfeet Nation\u2014Montana State Senator Susan Webber and rancher Jonathan St. Goddard\u2014filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Montana against the United States, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, in her official capacity. Represented by private counsel, plaintiffs challenged a series of executive actions issued by President Donald Trump that imposed tariffs on goods entering from Canada. The plaintiffs argue that the tariffs unlawfully burden commerce and travel essential to Blackfeet citizens and violate longstanding treaty protections and constitutional guarantees.\n\nThe challenged actions include multiple executive orders and proclamations\u2014collectively referred to as the \u201cCanada Orders.\u201d These include: (1) Executive Order 14193 (Feb. 1, 2025), which declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA); (2) Proclamations 10895 and 10896, which levied 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act; and (3) Executive Order 14257 (Apr. 2, 2025), which introduced reciprocal tariffs to counter perceived trade imbalances. Plaintiffs claim these measures, which apply universally without exemptions for Indigenous trade, violate constitutional principles and federal treaties.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert multiple legal theories. First, they argue that the President lacked statutory authority to impose tariffs of this scale and scope. Specifically, they contend that IEEPA does not authorize universal tariffs unrelated to a clear foreign threat and that the Trade Expansion Act's delegation of power under Section 232 cannot justify these broad economic measures. Second, they allege that the executive actions violate the separation of powers by encroaching on Congress\u2019s exclusive authority over foreign commerce under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.\n\nIn addition to constitutional structure, the plaintiffs raise claims under the Due Process Clause. They argue that the tariffs impose arbitrary and sweeping economic burdens without procedural safeguards or individualized assessment. The complaint also references historical protections under the Jay Treaty of 1794, the Treaty of Ghent (1814), and early federal tariff acts that explicitly exempted Indigenous trade from duties. The plaintiffs maintain that these protections remain valid, self-executing treaty rights that predate and override later conflicting executive actions.\n\nTo support their claims, the plaintiffs filed declarations and affidavits documenting the concrete harms caused by the tariffs. These include rising business costs, lost tourism income, and disrupted family and trade relations across the northern border. In particular, Senator Webber emphasized the disproportionate impact on the Blackfeet Nation, whose homelands, commerce, and kinship networks span both sides of the U.S.\u2013Canada border.\n\nPlaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, they asked the Court to declare key portions of the Canada Orders unconstitutional, enjoin their enforcement, and, alternatively, exempt tribally enrolled members or tribal border crossings from the tariffs. They also sought attorneys\u2019 fees and any other relief deemed just and proper.\n\nThis case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Dana L. Christensen. On April 4, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary and permanent injunction. On April 11, they filed an amended complaint adding four additional plaintiffs: Ryan Biederman, Andrea Bocanegra, David Greer, and Lisa Ruelas. On April 14, the government moved to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade and requested a stay of proceedings pending that decision. Plaintiffs opposed both motions, arguing that their constitutional and treaty-based claims require resolution in a federal district court with jurisdiction over constitutional and equitable claims.\n\nOn April 21, 2025, the Montana Farmers Union (MFU) moved the court to intervene as a party-plaintiff.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the court granted the defendants' motion to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade and denied their motion to stay as moot. Plaintiffs immediately appealed the transfer order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and filed a motion in the district court for a preliminary injunction pending appeal. On April 28, plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the transfer order. That same day, the district court denied their request for a preliminary injunction pending appeal.\n\nIn the Court of Appeals, plaintiff-appellants filed a motion for injunctive relief on May 1, 2025. Defendant-appellees filed a motion to dismiss that same day. On May 23, the court denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice and ordered that all appellate proceedings, except for mediation, be stayed pending the district court's ruling on the timely tolling motion filed on April 28, 2025.\n\nOn June 2, the district court denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. Following this, plaintiffs filed a motion to expedite in the Court of Appeals, arguing that the stay previously entered was moot in light of the district court's ruling. They requested that the Court of Appeals set an expedited briefing schedule on the merits of their appeal and grant their fully briefed motion for a preliminary injunction. The motion for an expedited briefing schedule was granted on June 18.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

The plaintiffs argue that the tariffs unlawfully burden commerce and travel essential to Blackfeet citizens and violate longstanding treaty protections and constitutional guarantees.\n\nThe challenged actions include multiple executive orders and proclamations\u2014collectively referred to as the \u201cCanada Orders.\u201d These include: (1) Executive Order 14193 (Feb. 1, 2025), which declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA); (2) Proclamations 10895 and 10896, which levied 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act; and (3) Executive Order 14257 (Apr. 2, 2025), which introduced reciprocal tariffs to counter perceived trade imbalances. Plaintiffs claim these measures, which apply universally without exemptions for Indigenous trade, violate constitutional principles and federal treaties.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert multiple legal theories. First, they argue that the President lacked statutory authority to impose tariffs of this scale and scope. Specifically, they contend that IEEPA does not authorize universal tariffs unrelated to a clear foreign threat and that the Trade Expansion Act's delegation of power under Section 232 cannot justify these broad economic measures. Second, they allege that the executive actions violate the separation of powers by encroaching on Congress\u2019s exclusive authority over foreign commerce under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.\n\nIn addition to constitutional structure, the plaintiffs raise claims under the Due Process Clause. They argue that the tariffs impose arbitrary and sweeping economic burdens without procedural safeguards or individualized assessment. The complaint also references historical protections under the Jay Treaty of 1794, the Treaty of Ghent (1814), and early federal tariff acts that explicitly exempted Indigenous trade from duties. The plaintiffs maintain that these protections remain valid, self-executing treaty rights that predate and override later conflicting executive actions.\n\nTo support their claims, the plaintiffs filed declarations and affidavits documenting the concrete harms caused by the tariffs. These include rising business costs, lost tourism income, and disrupted family and trade relations across the northern border. In particular, Senator Webber emphasized the disproportionate impact on the Blackfeet Nation, whose homelands, commerce, and kinship networks span both sides of the U.S.\u2013Canada border.\n\nPlaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, they asked the Court to declare key portions of the Canada Orders unconstitutional, enjoin their enforcement, and, alternatively, exempt tribally enrolled members or tribal border crossings from the tariffs. They also sought attorneys\u2019 fees and any other relief deemed just and proper.\n\nThis case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Dana L. Christensen. On April 4, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary and permanent injunction. On April 11, they filed an amended complaint adding four additional plaintiffs: Ryan Biederman, Andrea Bocanegra, David Greer, and Lisa Ruelas. On April 14, the government moved to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade and requested a stay of proceedings pending that decision. Plaintiffs opposed both motions, arguing that their constitutional and treaty-based claims require resolution in a federal district court with jurisdiction over constitutional and equitable claims.\n\nOn April 21, 2025, the Montana Farmers Union (MFU) moved the court to intervene as a party-plaintiff.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the court granted the defendants' motion to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade and denied their motion to stay as moot. Plaintiffs immediately appealed the transfer order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and filed a motion in the district court for a preliminary injunction pending appeal. On April 28, plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the transfer order. That same day, the district court denied their request for a preliminary injunction pending appeal.\n\nIn the Court of Appeals, plaintiff-appellants filed a motion for injunctive relief on May 1, 2025. Defendant-appellees filed a motion to dismiss that same day. On May 23, the court denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice and ordered that all appellate proceedings, except for mediation, be stayed pending the district court's ruling on the timely tolling motion filed on April 28, 2025.\n\nOn June 2, the district court denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. Following this, plaintiffs filed a motion to expedite in the Court of Appeals, arguing that the stay previously entered was moot in light of the district court's ruling. They requested that the Court of Appeals set an expedited briefing schedule on the merits of their appeal and grant their fully briefed motion for a preliminary injunction. The motion for an expedited briefing schedule was granted on June 18.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

Second, they allege that the executive actions violate the separation of powers by encroaching on Congress\u2019s exclusive authority over foreign commerce under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.\n\nIn addition to constitutional structure, the plaintiffs raise claims under the Due Process Clause. They argue that the tariffs impose arbitrary and sweeping economic burdens without procedural safeguards or individualized assessment.

    "target": "This case raises urgent questions about the scope of presidential authority over trade and the constitutional rights of Indigenous communities living along the U.S.\u2013Canada border. On April 4, 2025, two members of the Blackfeet Nation\u2014Montana State Senator Susan Webber and rancher Jonathan St. Goddard\u2014filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Montana against the United States, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, in her official capacity. Represented by private counsel, plaintiffs challenged a series of executive actions issued by President Donald Trump that imposed tariffs on goods entering from Canada. The plaintiffs argue that the tariffs unlawfully burden commerce and travel essential to Blackfeet citizens and violate longstanding treaty protections and constitutional guarantees.\n\nThe challenged actions include multiple executive orders and proclamations\u2014collectively referred to as the \u201cCanada Orders.\u201d These include: (1) Executive Order 14193 (Feb. 1, 2025), which declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA); (2) Proclamations 10895 and 10896, which levied 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act; and (3) Executive Order 14257 (Apr. 2, 2025), which introduced reciprocal tariffs to counter perceived trade imbalances. Plaintiffs claim these measures, which apply universally without exemptions for Indigenous trade, violate constitutional principles and federal treaties.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert multiple legal theories. First, they argue that the President lacked statutory authority to impose tariffs of this scale and scope. Specifically, they contend that IEEPA does not authorize universal tariffs unrelated to a clear foreign threat and that the Trade Expansion Act's delegation of power under Section 232 cannot justify these broad economic measures. Second, they allege that the executive actions violate the separation of powers by encroaching on Congress\u2019s exclusive authority over foreign commerce under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.\n\nIn addition to constitutional structure, the plaintiffs raise claims under the Due Process Clause. They argue that the tariffs impose arbitrary and sweeping economic burdens without procedural safeguards or individualized assessment. The complaint also references historical protections under the Jay Treaty of 1794, the Treaty of Ghent (1814), and early federal tariff acts that explicitly exempted Indigenous trade from duties. The plaintiffs maintain that these protections remain valid, self-executing treaty rights that predate and override later conflicting executive actions.\n\nTo support their claims, the plaintiffs filed declarations and affidavits documenting the concrete harms caused by the tariffs. These include rising business costs, lost tourism income, and disrupted family and trade relations across the northern border. In particular, Senator Webber emphasized the disproportionate impact on the Blackfeet Nation, whose homelands, commerce, and kinship networks span both sides of the U.S.\u2013Canada border.\n\nPlaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, they asked the Court to declare key portions of the Canada Orders unconstitutional, enjoin their enforcement, and, alternatively, exempt tribally enrolled members or tribal border crossings from the tariffs. They also sought attorneys\u2019 fees and any other relief deemed just and proper.\n\nThis case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Dana L. Christensen. On April 4, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary and permanent injunction. On April 11, they filed an amended complaint adding four additional plaintiffs: Ryan Biederman, Andrea Bocanegra, David Greer, and Lisa Ruelas. On April 14, the government moved to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade and requested a stay of proceedings pending that decision. Plaintiffs opposed both motions, arguing that their constitutional and treaty-based claims require resolution in a federal district court with jurisdiction over constitutional and equitable claims.\n\nOn April 21, 2025, the Montana Farmers Union (MFU) moved the court to intervene as a party-plaintiff.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the court granted the defendants' motion to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade and denied their motion to stay as moot. Plaintiffs immediately appealed the transfer order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and filed a motion in the district court for a preliminary injunction pending appeal. On April 28, plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the transfer order. That same day, the district court denied their request for a preliminary injunction pending appeal.\n\nIn the Court of Appeals, plaintiff-appellants filed a motion for injunctive relief on May 1, 2025. Defendant-appellees filed a motion to dismiss that same day. On May 23, the court denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice and ordered that all appellate proceedings, except for mediation, be stayed pending the district court's ruling on the timely tolling motion filed on April 28, 2025.\n\nOn June 2, the district court denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. Following this, plaintiffs filed a motion to expedite in the Court of Appeals, arguing that the stay previously entered was moot in light of the district court's ruling. They requested that the Court of Appeals set an expedited briefing schedule on the merits of their appeal and grant their fully briefed motion for a preliminary injunction. The motion for an expedited briefing schedule was granted on June 18.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",
