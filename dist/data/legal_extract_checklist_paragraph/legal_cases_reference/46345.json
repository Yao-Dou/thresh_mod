    "target": "In this case, non-profit organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) challenged the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) April 1, 2025, closure of its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) office and the CDC\u2019s non-compliance with CREW\u2019s subsequent FOIA requests for expedited processing. The FOIA requests sought, per CREW\u2019s complaint, \u201crecords regarding the agency\u2019s staff reductions and other matters of significant public interest\u201d\u2014including an ongoing, national measles outbreak. To see the Clearinghouse\u2019s coverage of other litigation against the second Trump administration, click here [../../../../collections/38759].\n\nHHS disbanded the CDC\u2019s FOIA office and placed the office\u2019s staff on administrative leave following the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) March 27, 2025 announcement that it would cut 20,000 full-time employees\u2014reducing the workforce from 82,000 to 62,000\u2014in what the agency called \u201ca dramatic restructuring in accordance with President Trump's Executive Order, \u2018Implementing the President\u2019s \"Department of Government Efficiency\" Workforce Optimization Initiative\u2019\u201d (EO 14210) (see the HHS press release, here [https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restructuring-doge.html]). EO 14210 included the directive: \u201cAgency Heads shall promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law.\u201d\n\nOn April 4, 2025, CREW, a non-partisan government watchdog organization filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. CREW named the CDC, HHS, and the heads of those departments as defendants. Represented by in-house attorneys, CREW sought declaratory and injunctive relief under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiff claimed that the abrupt elimination of the CDC\u2019s entire FOIA office violated federal law and blocked public access to critical government records on issues of national importance\u2014including \u201congoing outbreaks . . . of measles and other highly contagious diseases.\u201d Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants: violated FOIA by wrongfully denying expedited processing of CREW\u2019s FOIA requests; had a \u201cpolicy or practice\u201d of violating FOIA; and violated the APA by taking unlawful, arbitrary and capricious agency action.\n\nCREW asked the court to declare the agency\u2019s actions unlawful, enjoin the government from continuing to block FOIA operations, and compel expedited processing of CREW's pending requests. The organization also sought attorneys\u2019 fees. The case was assigned to District Judge Timothy J. Kelly.\n\nOn April 21, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction and partial summary judgment, on which the court held argument on May 13. The plaintiffs requested partial summary judgment on their claims that the CDC violated FOIA and that its actions were contrary to law under the APA, but not on their arbitrary and capricious argument. The plaintiffs argued that briefing on both motions could take place simultaneously, since there were no disputed factual issues with regard to those issues, and claimed that \"expeditious final disposition will benefit CREW and the public so that they can be assured of access to the vital information at issue in this case.\"\n\nThe court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction on June 4, finding that plaintiffs failed to establish irreparable harm in the absence of relief. CREW had suggested two theories: First, CREW argued that without fast processing of its information requests, \"it w[ould] be unable to give the public important information relevant to ongoing debates about measles and transparency within HHS and CDC.\" Second, CREW argued that if the CDC continued to ignore FOIA requests, given CREW's reliance on FOIA to obtain information for the public, CREW would suffer irreparable harm to its \"organizational mission.\" The court rejected both arguments. On the first, the court found that \"CREW has not shown that the records will imminently lose significant value without a preliminary injunction,\" meaning that any harm suffered would not be irreparable. As for the second argument, the court found on the record before it \"any harm to CREW\u2019s organizational mission caused by HHS\u2019s FOIA overhaul is not irreparable harm under FOIA.\" Therefore, the court denied the motion.\n\nOn June 17, pursuant to an agreement between the parties, the court ordered an expedited schedule for the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint and a motion for summary judgment, as well as a government opposition or cross-motion, and extended the time to answer the amended complaint. The plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on June 25. The amended complaint expanded on the factual and legal allegations regarding FOIA and how the CDC's failure to provide information violates the statute. The complaint also added additional detail on the current status of the CDC's current FOIA operations, noting that the office is not currently fulfilling its responsibilities. The complaint also removed the plaintiffs' arbitrary and capricious claim under the APA and the corresponding request for declaratory relief under the APA. The plaintiffs also filed a motion for summary judgment on July 17, arguing that they were entitled to summary judgment on their claims that the CDC had a \"policy or practice\" of FOIA noncompliance, and that the closure of CDC's FOIA office was contrary to law under the APA.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "In this case, non-profit organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) challenged the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) April 1, 2025, closure of its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) office and the CDC\u2019s non-compliance with CREW\u2019s subsequent FOIA requests for expedited processing. The FOIA requests sought, per CREW\u2019s complaint, \u201crecords regarding the agency\u2019s staff reductions and other matters of significant public interest\u201d\u2014including an ongoing, national measles outbreak. To see the Clearinghouse\u2019s coverage of other litigation against the second Trump administration, click here [../../../../collections/38759].\n\nHHS disbanded the CDC\u2019s FOIA office and placed the office\u2019s staff on administrative leave following the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) March 27, 2025 announcement that it would cut 20,000 full-time employees\u2014reducing the workforce from 82,000 to 62,000\u2014in what the agency called \u201ca dramatic restructuring in accordance with President Trump's Executive Order, \u2018Implementing the President\u2019s \"Department of Government Efficiency\" Workforce Optimization Initiative\u2019\u201d (EO 14210) (see the HHS press release, here [https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restructuring-doge.html]). EO 14210 included the directive: \u201cAgency Heads shall promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law.\u201d\n\nOn April 4, 2025, CREW, a non-partisan government watchdog organization filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. CREW named the CDC, HHS, and the heads of those departments as defendants. Represented by in-house attorneys, CREW sought declaratory and injunctive relief under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiff claimed that the abrupt elimination of the CDC\u2019s entire FOIA office violated federal law and blocked public access to critical government records on issues of national importance\u2014including \u201congoing outbreaks . . . of measles and other highly contagious diseases.\u201d Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants: violated FOIA by wrongfully denying expedited processing of CREW\u2019s FOIA requests; had a \u201cpolicy or practice\u201d of violating FOIA; and violated the APA by taking unlawful, arbitrary and capricious agency action.\n\nCREW asked the court to declare the agency\u2019s actions unlawful, enjoin the government from continuing to block FOIA operations, and compel expedited processing of CREW's pending requests. The organization also sought attorneys\u2019 fees. The case was assigned to District Judge Timothy J. Kelly.\n\nOn April 21, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction and partial summary judgment, on which the court held argument on May 13. The plaintiffs requested partial summary judgment on their claims that the CDC violated FOIA and that its actions were contrary to law under the APA, but not on their arbitrary and capricious argument. The plaintiffs argued that briefing on both motions could take place simultaneously, since there were no disputed factual issues with regard to those issues, and claimed that \"expeditious final disposition will benefit CREW and the public so that they can be assured of access to the vital information at issue in this case.\"\n\nThe court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction on June 4, finding that plaintiffs failed to establish irreparable harm in the absence of relief. CREW had suggested two theories: First, CREW argued that without fast processing of its information requests, \"it w[ould] be unable to give the public important information relevant to ongoing debates about measles and transparency within HHS and CDC.\" Second, CREW argued that if the CDC continued to ignore FOIA requests, given CREW's reliance on FOIA to obtain information for the public, CREW would suffer irreparable harm to its \"organizational mission.\" The court rejected both arguments. On the first, the court found that \"CREW has not shown that the records will imminently lose significant value without a preliminary injunction,\" meaning that any harm suffered would not be irreparable. As for the second argument, the court found on the record before it \"any harm to CREW\u2019s organizational mission caused by HHS\u2019s FOIA overhaul is not irreparable harm under FOIA.\" Therefore, the court denied the motion.\n\nOn June 17, pursuant to an agreement between the parties, the court ordered an expedited schedule for the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint and a motion for summary judgment, as well as a government opposition or cross-motion, and extended the time to answer the amended complaint. The plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on June 25. The amended complaint expanded on the factual and legal allegations regarding FOIA and how the CDC's failure to provide information violates the statute. The complaint also added additional detail on the current status of the CDC's current FOIA operations, noting that the office is not currently fulfilling its responsibilities. The complaint also removed the plaintiffs' arbitrary and capricious claim under the APA and the corresponding request for declaratory relief under the APA. The plaintiffs also filed a motion for summary judgment on July 17, arguing that they were entitled to summary judgment on their claims that the CDC had a \"policy or practice\" of FOIA noncompliance, and that the closure of CDC's FOIA office was contrary to law under the APA.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "In this case, non-profit organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) challenged the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) April 1, 2025, closure of its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) office and the CDC\u2019s non-compliance with CREW\u2019s subsequent FOIA requests for expedited processing. The FOIA requests sought, per CREW\u2019s complaint, \u201crecords regarding the agency\u2019s staff reductions and other matters of significant public interest\u201d\u2014including an ongoing, national measles outbreak. To see the Clearinghouse\u2019s coverage of other litigation against the second Trump administration, click here [../../../../collections/38759].\n\nHHS disbanded the CDC\u2019s FOIA office and placed the office\u2019s staff on administrative leave following the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) March 27, 2025 announcement that it would cut 20,000 full-time employees\u2014reducing the workforce from 82,000 to 62,000\u2014in what the agency called \u201ca dramatic restructuring in accordance with President Trump's Executive Order, \u2018Implementing the President\u2019s \"Department of Government Efficiency\" Workforce Optimization Initiative\u2019\u201d (EO 14210) (see the HHS press release, here [https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restructuring-doge.html]). EO 14210 included the directive: \u201cAgency Heads shall promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law.\u201d\n\nOn April 4, 2025, CREW, a non-partisan government watchdog organization filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. CREW named the CDC, HHS, and the heads of those departments as defendants. Represented by in-house attorneys, CREW sought declaratory and injunctive relief under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiff claimed that the abrupt elimination of the CDC\u2019s entire FOIA office violated federal law and blocked public access to critical government records on issues of national importance\u2014including \u201congoing outbreaks . . . of measles and other highly contagious diseases.\u201d Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants: violated FOIA by wrongfully denying expedited processing of CREW\u2019s FOIA requests; had a \u201cpolicy or practice\u201d of violating FOIA; and violated the APA by taking unlawful, arbitrary and capricious agency action.\n\nCREW asked the court to declare the agency\u2019s actions unlawful, enjoin the government from continuing to block FOIA operations, and compel expedited processing of CREW's pending requests. The organization also sought attorneys\u2019 fees. The case was assigned to District Judge Timothy J. Kelly.\n\nOn April 21, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction and partial summary judgment, on which the court held argument on May 13. The plaintiffs requested partial summary judgment on their claims that the CDC violated FOIA and that its actions were contrary to law under the APA, but not on their arbitrary and capricious argument. The plaintiffs argued that briefing on both motions could take place simultaneously, since there were no disputed factual issues with regard to those issues, and claimed that \"expeditious final disposition will benefit CREW and the public so that they can be assured of access to the vital information at issue in this case.\"\n\nThe court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction on June 4, finding that plaintiffs failed to establish irreparable harm in the absence of relief. CREW had suggested two theories: First, CREW argued that without fast processing of its information requests, \"it w[ould] be unable to give the public important information relevant to ongoing debates about measles and transparency within HHS and CDC.\" Second, CREW argued that if the CDC continued to ignore FOIA requests, given CREW's reliance on FOIA to obtain information for the public, CREW would suffer irreparable harm to its \"organizational mission.\" The court rejected both arguments. On the first, the court found that \"CREW has not shown that the records will imminently lose significant value without a preliminary injunction,\" meaning that any harm suffered would not be irreparable. As for the second argument, the court found on the record before it \"any harm to CREW\u2019s organizational mission caused by HHS\u2019s FOIA overhaul is not irreparable harm under FOIA.\" Therefore, the court denied the motion.\n\nOn June 17, pursuant to an agreement between the parties, the court ordered an expedited schedule for the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint and a motion for summary judgment, as well as a government opposition or cross-motion, and extended the time to answer the amended complaint. The plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on June 25. The amended complaint expanded on the factual and legal allegations regarding FOIA and how the CDC's failure to provide information violates the statute.

The FOIA requests sought, per CREW\u2019s complaint, \u201crecords regarding the agency\u2019s staff reductions and other matters of significant public interest\u201d\u2014including an ongoing, national measles outbreak. To see the Clearinghouse\u2019s coverage of other litigation against the second Trump administration, click here [../../../../collections/38759].\n\nHHS disbanded the CDC\u2019s FOIA office and placed the office\u2019s staff on administrative leave following the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) March 27, 2025 announcement that it would cut 20,000 full-time employees\u2014reducing the workforce from 82,000 to 62,000\u2014in what the agency called \u201ca dramatic restructuring in accordance with President Trump's Executive Order, \u2018Implementing the President\u2019s \"Department of Government Efficiency\" Workforce Optimization Initiative\u2019\u201d (EO 14210) (see the HHS press release, here [https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restructuring-doge.html]). EO 14210 included the directive: \u201cAgency Heads shall promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law.\u201d\n\nOn April 4, 2025, CREW, a non-partisan government watchdog organization filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. CREW named the CDC, HHS, and the heads of those departments as defendants. Represented by in-house attorneys, CREW sought declaratory and injunctive relief under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiff claimed that the abrupt elimination of the CDC\u2019s entire FOIA office violated federal law and blocked public access to critical government records on issues of national importance\u2014including \u201congoing outbreaks . . . of measles and other highly contagious diseases.\u201d Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants: violated FOIA by wrongfully denying expedited processing of CREW\u2019s FOIA requests; had a \u201cpolicy or practice\u201d of violating FOIA; and violated the APA by taking unlawful, arbitrary and capricious agency action.\n\nCREW asked the court to declare the agency\u2019s actions unlawful, enjoin the government from continuing to block FOIA operations, and compel expedited processing of CREW's pending requests. The organization also sought attorneys\u2019 fees. The case was assigned to District Judge Timothy J. Kelly.\n\nOn April 21, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction and partial summary judgment, on which the court held argument on May 13. The plaintiffs requested partial summary judgment on their claims that the CDC violated FOIA and that its actions were contrary to law under the APA, but not on their arbitrary and capricious argument. The plaintiffs argued that briefing on both motions could take place simultaneously, since there were no disputed factual issues with regard to those issues, and claimed that \"expeditious final disposition will benefit CREW and the public so that they can be assured of access to the vital information at issue in this case.\"\n\nThe court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction on June 4, finding that plaintiffs failed to establish irreparable harm in the absence of relief. CREW had suggested two theories: First, CREW argued that without fast processing of its information requests, \"it w[ould] be unable to give the public important information relevant to ongoing debates about measles and transparency within HHS and CDC.\" Second, CREW argued that if the CDC continued to ignore FOIA requests, given CREW's reliance on FOIA to obtain information for the public, CREW would suffer irreparable harm to its \"organizational mission.\" The court rejected both arguments. On the first, the court found that \"CREW has not shown that the records will imminently lose significant value without a preliminary injunction,\" meaning that any harm suffered would not be irreparable. As for the second argument, the court found on the record before it \"any harm to CREW\u2019s organizational mission caused by HHS\u2019s FOIA overhaul is not irreparable harm under FOIA.\" Therefore, the court denied the motion.\n\nOn June 17, pursuant to an agreement between the parties, the court ordered an expedited schedule for the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint and a motion for summary judgment, as well as a government opposition or cross-motion, and extended the time to answer the amended complaint. The plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on June 25. The amended complaint expanded on the factual and legal allegations regarding FOIA and how the CDC's failure to provide information violates the statute. The complaint also added additional detail on the current status of the CDC's current FOIA operations, noting that the office is not currently fulfilling its responsibilities. The complaint also removed the plaintiffs' arbitrary and capricious claim under the APA and the corresponding request for declaratory relief under the APA. The plaintiffs also filed a motion for summary judgment on July 17, arguing that they were entitled to summary judgment on their claims that the CDC had a \"policy or practice\" of FOIA noncompliance, and that the closure of CDC's FOIA office was contrary to law under the APA.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",
