The plaintiff challenged the Trump Administration's ongoing freeze of money that had been previously delegated and committed to the plaintiff for the care of lawful refugees.\n\nOn January 27, 2025, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum directing all federal agencies to \"temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance.\" While the OMB rescinded the memo less than two days later, the plaintiffs pointed to another case, National Council of Nonprofits v. Office of Management and Budget [../../../../case/45977/],\u00a0in which Judge AliKhan had found that the Administration was still seeking to restrict federal funding and issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) requiring federal agencies not to freeze funding.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that, since January 30, they had made multiple requests for payment from the Payment Management Services (PMS) system, but they had received no funds, and HHS had failed to provide a legal rationale for the failure. The plaintiffs requested declaratory and injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging that the defendants' actions were a violation of their statutory authority, the Appropriations Clause, and the Spending Clause, and were arbitrary and capricious. The plaintiffs asked the court to declare the defendants' actions unlawful and to enjoin the defendants from implementing a funding freeze against CCFW in the future.\n\nOn March 2, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). The case was assigned to District Judge Loren L. AliKhan because of the case's relation to National Council of Nonprofits. Judge AliKhan held a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion on March 12.\n\nFollowing a status conference on March 13, the court instructed the parties to file multiple status reports on the current status of the plaintiffs' payment requests.
