    "target": "On June 6, 2025, federal law enforcement arrived in Los Angeles to launch what Trump Administration officials described as \u201cthe largest Mass Deportation Operation in History.\u201d This case challenges the enforcement practices used during that operation, focusing specifically on the use of roving patrols. Petitioners alleged that federal agents conducted indiscriminate roundups without reasonable suspicion, often appearing masked, without visible badges or identification, and without identifying their agency. These patrols were further alleged to have based detentive stops not on individualized suspicion but on factors such as race, ethnicity, accent, or presence at day laborer sites, bus stops, car washes, or agricultural locations. Certain case documents, including the original petition, have not been made publicly available.\n\nOn June 18, 2025, in Pasadena, California, several individuals were arrested while waiting for a job and subsequently detained in the basement of the Los Angeles federal building (B-18), where they reported experiencing dungeon-like conditions, crowded, unsanitary conditions with limited access to basic necessities and medical care, and were denied phone calls.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, these individuals, along with Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, and organizations such as the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, United Farm Workers, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, and Immigrant Defenders Law Center, filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The petitioners sued the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of a regional ICE field office, the U.S. Attorney General, and various other federal officials from agencies including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Border Patrol, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The case was assigned to District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong and referred to Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym.\n\nRepresented by attorneys and legal representatives from the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) and Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), the petitioners sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. They argued that the defendants\u2019 operation involved two unconstitutional features: \u201croving patrols\u201d indiscriminately rounding up numerous individuals without reasonable suspicion and denying these individuals access to lawyers, which they contended violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution, respectively.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the petitioners filed a first amended complaint and an application for a temporary restraining order concerning access to counsel. The next day, on July 3, 2025, they filed a second application for a temporary restraining order focusing on unlawful stops.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, Judge Frimpong granted a temporary restraining order and order to show cause regarding a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1915964. The court concluded that the petitioners were likely to succeed in showing that the defendants had conducted roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and had denied access to lawyers, in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, respectively. The court also highlighted restricted access to counsel for individuals detained at B-18, noting that attorneys and legal representatives were often denied entry or permitted only brief, limited visits. Accordingly, the court ordered the defendants to cease these practices, specifically prohibiting federal agents from conducting detentive stops without reasonable suspicion of an immigration violation and forbidding reliance solely on four factors (alone or in combination): the district court temporarily enjoined the government from stopping people based only on four factors, alone or in combination: \u00a0race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or accented English; presence in certain kinds of locations frequented by the public, like bus stops, car washes, and parking lots; and type of occupation. \u00a0The order further required immigration agencies to provide detainees with access to attorneys or legal representatives seven days a week, including confidential, unmonitored telephone calls at no charge.\n\nOn July 13, 2025, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On July 14, 2025, they filed a motion to stay the district court\u2019s TRO pending appeal. On July 16, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motions to stay the district court\u2019s injunction pending appeal, without prejudice. The court found that DHS and other defendants failed to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8 because they neither sought a stay pending appeal from the district court nor showed that doing so was impracticable.\n\nBack in the district court, petitioner Carlos Osorto filed an application for release from immigration custody on July 21, 2025. Petitioner Osorto argued his case was extraordinary because he withdrew his TRO request and delayed briefing based on DHS\u2019s promise of a bond hearing, only for DHS to later deny the immigration court\u2019s jurisdiction. After reversing course again, DHS requested a hearing, which was denied for lack of new facts or jurisdictional basis. Osorto also cited serious, persistent health issues, including dizziness, confusion, and a blood pressure reading of 190. The court granted Osorto\u2019s application for release from immigration custody on July 30, 2025. The court found \"special and unusual circumstances,\" citing DHS\u2019s shifting positions, Osorto\u2019s serious health issues, and the immigration court\u2019s repeated refusal to hear the case. The court held it had habeas authority to grant bail, found Osorto neither a danger nor flight risk, and ordered his immediate release on a $5,000 bond with ankle monitoring, declining to stay the order due to his condition.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion to stay the TRO, finding the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits. However, the court agreed with the defendants that the TRO\u2019s clause \u201cexcept as permitted by law\u201d was impermissibly vague and that they were likely to succeed on the merits of that specific challenge.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit found that the individual plaintiffs had standing to seek injunctive relief due to a \"realistic threat\" of being stopped again without reasonable suspicion, as the harm resulted from a \"pattern of officially sanctioned behavior.\" The court noted that in the Central District of California, where the stops occurred and approximately 47 percent of the population is Hispanic or Latino, factors such as apparent race, ethnicity, language, or accent had \"limited probative value\" in establishing reasonable suspicion. The court also concluded that a person\u2019s presence at places like car washes or bus stops, or the type of work they do, did little to arouse reasonable suspicion. Finally, the court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that the TRO would have a \"chilling effect\" on enforcement, finding that defendants \"cannot reasonably assert that [they are] harmed in any legally cognizable sense by being enjoined from constitutional violations.\"\n\nOn August 7, 2025, the defendants filed a motion in the Supreme Court seeking a stay of the district court's TRO decision. The Administration argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they had not shown a sufficient risk of future unlawful encounters with law enforcement, and that past incidents did not establish such a risk. They claimed the district court order imposed a \u201cstraitjacket\u201d on enforcement that was \u201cinimical to the context- and case-specific totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry\u201d required by the Fourth Amendment, and that the lower court erred in holding that the four prohibited factors\u2014again, apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or accented English, presence at locations where undocumented immigrants gather, and certain jobs like landscaping or construction\u2014could never contribute to reasonable suspicion. They argued that actually race, ethnicity, language, etc. were appropriate factors for reasonable suspicion, but complained that under the order:\n\nThe only safe harbor for an immigration agent in the Central District of California would be to ignore the apparent race or ethnicity, language, location, and occupation of a suspected illegal alien\u2014and thus to ignore factors that may often support reasonable suspicion in context.\n\nThey further argued that the district-wide injunction violated Trump v. CASA, Inc. (24A884), which barred such sweeping relief, noting that the August 1 order applied to all 20 million residents of the Central District rather than just the named respondents, and that it inflicted \u201cmanifest irreparable harm\u201d by hindering enforcement and making every stop a potential \u201ccontempt trap.\u201d\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) filed an amicus brief supporting the stay, arguing that the injunction misapplied the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonable suspicion standard. FAIR emphasized that temporary investigative stops required only reasonable suspicion, a lower threshold than probable cause, as established in Terry v. Ohio and reinforced in Kansas v. Glover.\n\nOn the same day, the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, and 20 other cities in the Central District of California filed an amicus brief opposing the stay. They contested the applicants\u2019 claim that \u201capparent ethnicity\u201d and language could justify stops and detentions, noting that applying this standard would have subjected over half of the Central District\u2019s population, including millions of U.S. citizens, to detention. They further argued that the applicants\u2019 unconstitutional actions had harmed communities by diverting local law enforcement resources, reducing public cooperation, and deterring victims and witnesses from participating in the justice system.\n\nThis case remains active at all three levels of federal court: In the Central District of California, briefing proceeds on a preliminary injunction (with a hearing scheduled for September 24, 2025), and class certification.\u00a0 In the Ninth Circuit, the TRO appeal is pending. And in the Supreme Court, stay briefing concluded on August 13.",

The court held it had habeas authority to grant bail, found Osorto neither a danger nor flight risk, and ordered his immediate release on a $5,000 bond with ankle monitoring, declining to stay the order due to his condition.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion to stay the TRO, finding the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits. However, the court agreed with the defendants that the TRO\u2019s clause \u201cexcept as permitted by law\u201d was impermissibly vague and that they were likely to succeed on the merits of that specific challenge.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit found that the individual plaintiffs had standing to seek injunctive relief due to a \"realistic threat\" of being stopped again without reasonable suspicion, as the harm resulted from a \"pattern of officially sanctioned behavior.\" The court noted that in the Central District of California, where the stops occurred and approximately 47 percent of the population is Hispanic or Latino, factors such as apparent race, ethnicity, language, or accent had \"limited probative value\" in establishing reasonable suspicion. The court also concluded that a person\u2019s presence at places like car washes or bus stops, or the type of work they do, did little to arouse reasonable suspicion. Finally, the court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that the TRO would have a \"chilling effect\" on enforcement, finding that defendants \"cannot reasonably assert that [they are] harmed in any legally cognizable sense by being enjoined from constitutional violations.\"\n\nOn August 7, 2025, the defendants filed a motion in the Supreme Court seeking a stay of the district court's TRO decision. The Administration argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they had not shown a sufficient risk of future unlawful encounters with law enforcement, and that past incidents did not establish such a risk. They claimed the district court order imposed a \u201cstraitjacket\u201d on enforcement that was \u201cinimical to the context- and case-specific totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry\u201d required by the Fourth Amendment, and that the lower court erred in holding that the four prohibited factors\u2014again, apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or accented English, presence at locations where undocumented immigrants gather, and certain jobs like landscaping or construction\u2014could never contribute to reasonable suspicion. They argued that actually race, ethnicity, language, etc. were appropriate factors for reasonable suspicion, but complained that under the order:\n\nThe only safe harbor for an immigration agent in the Central District of California would be to ignore the apparent race or ethnicity, language, location, and occupation of a suspected illegal alien\u2014and thus to ignore factors that may often support reasonable suspicion in context.\n\nThey further argued that the district-wide injunction violated Trump v. CASA, Inc. (24A884), which barred such sweeping relief, noting that the August 1 order applied to all 20 million residents of the Central District rather than just the named respondents, and that it inflicted \u201cmanifest irreparable harm\u201d by hindering enforcement and making every stop a potential \u201ccontempt trap.\u201d\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) filed an amicus brief supporting the stay, arguing that the injunction misapplied the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonable suspicion standard. FAIR emphasized that temporary investigative stops required only reasonable suspicion, a lower threshold than probable cause, as established in Terry v. Ohio and reinforced in Kansas v. Glover.\n\nOn the same day, the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, and 20 other cities in the Central District of California filed an amicus brief opposing the stay. They contested the applicants\u2019 claim that \u201capparent ethnicity\u201d and language could justify stops and detentions, noting that applying this standard would have subjected over half of the Central District\u2019s population, including millions of U.S. citizens, to detention. They further argued that the applicants\u2019 unconstitutional actions had harmed communities by diverting local law enforcement resources, reducing public cooperation, and deterring victims and witnesses from participating in the justice system.\n\nThis case remains active at all three levels of federal court: In the Central District of California, briefing proceeds on a preliminary injunction (with a hearing scheduled for September 24, 2025), and class certification.\u00a0 In the Ninth Circuit, the TRO appeal is pending. And in the Supreme Court, stay briefing concluded on August 13.",

    "target": "On June 6, 2025, federal law enforcement arrived in Los Angeles to launch what Trump Administration officials described as \u201cthe largest Mass Deportation Operation in History.\u201d This case challenges the enforcement practices used during that operation, focusing specifically on the use of roving patrols. Petitioners alleged that federal agents conducted indiscriminate roundups without reasonable suspicion, often appearing masked, without visible badges or identification, and without identifying their agency. These patrols were further alleged to have based detentive stops not on individualized suspicion but on factors such as race, ethnicity, accent, or presence at day laborer sites, bus stops, car washes, or agricultural locations. Certain case documents, including the original petition, have not been made publicly available.\n\nOn June 18, 2025, in Pasadena, California, several individuals were arrested while waiting for a job and subsequently detained in the basement of the Los Angeles federal building (B-18), where they reported experiencing dungeon-like conditions, crowded, unsanitary conditions with limited access to basic necessities and medical care, and were denied phone calls.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, these individuals, along with Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, and organizations such as the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, United Farm Workers, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, and Immigrant Defenders Law Center, filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The petitioners sued the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of a regional ICE field office, the U.S. Attorney General, and various other federal officials from agencies including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Border Patrol, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The case was assigned to District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong and referred to Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym.\n\nRepresented by attorneys and legal representatives from the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) and Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), the petitioners sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. They argued that the defendants\u2019 operation involved two unconstitutional features: \u201croving patrols\u201d indiscriminately rounding up numerous individuals without reasonable suspicion and denying these individuals access to lawyers, which they contended violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution, respectively.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the petitioners filed a first amended complaint and an application for a temporary restraining order concerning access to counsel. The next day, on July 3, 2025, they filed a second application for a temporary restraining order focusing on unlawful stops.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, Judge Frimpong granted a temporary restraining order and order to show cause regarding a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1915964. The court concluded that the petitioners were likely to succeed in showing that the defendants had conducted roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and had denied access to lawyers, in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, respectively. The court also highlighted restricted access to counsel for individuals detained at B-18, noting that attorneys and legal representatives were often denied entry or permitted only brief, limited visits. Accordingly, the court ordered the defendants to cease these practices, specifically prohibiting federal agents from conducting detentive stops without reasonable suspicion of an immigration violation and forbidding reliance solely on four factors (alone or in combination): the district court temporarily enjoined the government from stopping people based only on four factors, alone or in combination: \u00a0race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or accented English; presence in certain kinds of locations frequented by the public, like bus stops, car washes, and parking lots; and type of occupation. \u00a0The order further required immigration agencies to provide detainees with access to attorneys or legal representatives seven days a week, including confidential, unmonitored telephone calls at no charge.\n\nOn July 13, 2025, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On July 14, 2025, they filed a motion to stay the district court\u2019s TRO pending appeal. On July 16, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motions to stay the district court\u2019s injunction pending appeal, without prejudice. The court found that DHS and other defendants failed to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8 because they neither sought a stay pending appeal from the district court nor showed that doing so was impracticable.\n\nBack in the district court, petitioner Carlos Osorto filed an application for release from immigration custody on July 21, 2025. Petitioner Osorto argued his case was extraordinary because he withdrew his TRO request and delayed briefing based on DHS\u2019s promise of a bond hearing, only for DHS to later deny the immigration court\u2019s jurisdiction. After reversing course again, DHS requested a hearing, which was denied for lack of new facts or jurisdictional basis. Osorto also cited serious, persistent health issues, including dizziness, confusion, and a blood pressure reading of 190. The court granted Osorto\u2019s application for release from immigration custody on July 30, 2025. The court found \"special and unusual circumstances,\" citing DHS\u2019s shifting positions, Osorto\u2019s serious health issues, and the immigration court\u2019s repeated refusal to hear the case. The court held it had habeas authority to grant bail, found Osorto neither a danger nor flight risk, and ordered his immediate release on a $5,000 bond with ankle monitoring, declining to stay the order due to his condition.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion to stay the TRO, finding the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits. However, the court agreed with the defendants that the TRO\u2019s clause \u201cexcept as permitted by law\u201d was impermissibly vague and that they were likely to succeed on the merits of that specific challenge.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit found that the individual plaintiffs had standing to seek injunctive relief due to a \"realistic threat\" of being stopped again without reasonable suspicion, as the harm resulted from a \"pattern of officially sanctioned behavior.\" The court noted that in the Central District of California, where the stops occurred and approximately 47 percent of the population is Hispanic or Latino, factors such as apparent race, ethnicity, language, or accent had \"limited probative value\" in establishing reasonable suspicion. The court also concluded that a person\u2019s presence at places like car washes or bus stops, or the type of work they do, did little to arouse reasonable suspicion. Finally, the court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that the TRO would have a \"chilling effect\" on enforcement, finding that defendants \"cannot reasonably assert that [they are] harmed in any legally cognizable sense by being enjoined from constitutional violations.\"\n\nOn August 7, 2025, the defendants filed a motion in the Supreme Court seeking a stay of the district court's TRO decision. The Administration argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they had not shown a sufficient risk of future unlawful encounters with law enforcement, and that past incidents did not establish such a risk. They claimed the district court order imposed a \u201cstraitjacket\u201d on enforcement that was \u201cinimical to the context- and case-specific totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry\u201d required by the Fourth Amendment, and that the lower court erred in holding that the four prohibited factors\u2014again, apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or accented English, presence at locations where undocumented immigrants gather, and certain jobs like landscaping or construction\u2014could never contribute to reasonable suspicion. They argued that actually race, ethnicity, language, etc. were appropriate factors for reasonable suspicion, but complained that under the order:\n\nThe only safe harbor for an immigration agent in the Central District of California would be to ignore the apparent race or ethnicity, language, location, and occupation of a suspected illegal alien\u2014and thus to ignore factors that may often support reasonable suspicion in context.\n\nThey further argued that the district-wide injunction violated Trump v. CASA, Inc. (24A884), which barred such sweeping relief, noting that the August 1 order applied to all 20 million residents of the Central District rather than just the named respondents, and that it inflicted \u201cmanifest irreparable harm\u201d by hindering enforcement and making every stop a potential \u201ccontempt trap.\u201d\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) filed an amicus brief supporting the stay, arguing that the injunction misapplied the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonable suspicion standard. FAIR emphasized that temporary investigative stops required only reasonable suspicion, a lower threshold than probable cause, as established in Terry v. Ohio and reinforced in Kansas v. Glover.\n\nOn the same day, the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, and 20 other cities in the Central District of California filed an amicus brief opposing the stay. They contested the applicants\u2019 claim that \u201capparent ethnicity\u201d and language could justify stops and detentions, noting that applying this standard would have subjected over half of the Central District\u2019s population, including millions of U.S. citizens, to detention. They further argued that the applicants\u2019 unconstitutional actions had harmed communities by diverting local law enforcement resources, reducing public cooperation, and deterring victims and witnesses from participating in the justice system.\n\nThis case remains active at all three levels of federal court: In the Central District of California, briefing proceeds on a preliminary injunction (with a hearing scheduled for September 24, 2025), and class certification.\u00a0 In the Ninth Circuit, the TRO appeal is pending. And in the Supreme Court, stay briefing concluded on August 13.",

    "target": "On June 6, 2025, federal law enforcement arrived in Los Angeles to launch what Trump Administration officials described as \u201cthe largest Mass Deportation Operation in History.\u201d This case challenges the enforcement practices used during that operation, focusing specifically on the use of roving patrols. Petitioners alleged that federal agents conducted indiscriminate roundups without reasonable suspicion, often appearing masked, without visible badges or identification, and without identifying their agency. These patrols were further alleged to have based detentive stops not on individualized suspicion but on factors such as race, ethnicity, accent, or presence at day laborer sites, bus stops, car washes, or agricultural locations. Certain case documents, including the original petition, have not been made publicly available.\n\nOn June 18, 2025, in Pasadena, California, several individuals were arrested while waiting for a job and subsequently detained in the basement of the Los Angeles federal building (B-18), where they reported experiencing dungeon-like conditions, crowded, unsanitary conditions with limited access to basic necessities and medical care, and were denied phone calls.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, these individuals, along with Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, and organizations such as the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, United Farm Workers, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, and Immigrant Defenders Law Center, filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The petitioners sued the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of a regional ICE field office, the U.S. Attorney General, and various other federal officials from agencies including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Border Patrol, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The case was assigned to District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong and referred to Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym.\n\nRepresented by attorneys and legal representatives from the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) and Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), the petitioners sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. They argued that the defendants\u2019 operation involved two unconstitutional features: \u201croving patrols\u201d indiscriminately rounding up numerous individuals without reasonable suspicion and denying these individuals access to lawyers, which they contended violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution, respectively.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the petitioners filed a first amended complaint and an application for a temporary restraining order concerning access to counsel. The next day, on July 3, 2025, they filed a second application for a temporary restraining order focusing on unlawful stops.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, Judge Frimpong granted a temporary restraining order and order to show cause regarding a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1915964. The court concluded that the petitioners were likely to succeed in showing that the defendants had conducted roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and had denied access to lawyers, in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, respectively. The court also highlighted restricted access to counsel for individuals detained at B-18, noting that attorneys and legal representatives were often denied entry or permitted only brief, limited visits. Accordingly, the court ordered the defendants to cease these practices, specifically prohibiting federal agents from conducting detentive stops without reasonable suspicion of an immigration violation and forbidding reliance solely on four factors (alone or in combination): the district court temporarily enjoined the government from stopping people based only on four factors, alone or in combination: \u00a0race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or accented English; presence in certain kinds of locations frequented by the public, like bus stops, car washes, and parking lots; and type of occupation. \u00a0The order further required immigration agencies to provide detainees with access to attorneys or legal representatives seven days a week, including confidential, unmonitored telephone calls at no charge.\n\nOn July 13, 2025, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On July 14, 2025, they filed a motion to stay the district court\u2019s TRO pending appeal. On July 16, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motions to stay the district court\u2019s injunction pending appeal, without prejudice. The court found that DHS and other defendants failed to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8 because they neither sought a stay pending appeal from the district court nor showed that doing so was impracticable.\n\nBack in the district court, petitioner Carlos Osorto filed an application for release from immigration custody on July 21, 2025. Petitioner Osorto argued his case was extraordinary because he withdrew his TRO request and delayed briefing based on DHS\u2019s promise of a bond hearing, only for DHS to later deny the immigration court\u2019s jurisdiction. After reversing course again, DHS requested a hearing, which was denied for lack of new facts or jurisdictional basis. Osorto also cited serious, persistent health issues, including dizziness, confusion, and a blood pressure reading of 190. The court granted Osorto\u2019s application for release from immigration custody on July 30, 2025. The court found \"special and unusual circumstances,\" citing DHS\u2019s shifting positions, Osorto\u2019s serious health issues, and the immigration court\u2019s repeated refusal to hear the case. The court held it had habeas authority to grant bail, found Osorto neither a danger nor flight risk, and ordered his immediate release on a $5,000 bond with ankle monitoring, declining to stay the order due to his condition.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion to stay the TRO, finding the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits. However, the court agreed with the defendants that the TRO\u2019s clause \u201cexcept as permitted by law\u201d was impermissibly vague and that they were likely to succeed on the merits of that specific challenge.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit found that the individual plaintiffs had standing to seek injunctive relief due to a \"realistic threat\" of being stopped again without reasonable suspicion, as the harm resulted from a \"pattern of officially sanctioned behavior.\" The court noted that in the Central District of California, where the stops occurred and approximately 47 percent of the population is Hispanic or Latino, factors such as apparent race, ethnicity, language, or accent had \"limited probative value\" in establishing reasonable suspicion. The court also concluded that a person\u2019s presence at places like car washes or bus stops, or the type of work they do, did little to arouse reasonable suspicion. Finally, the court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that the TRO would have a \"chilling effect\" on enforcement, finding that defendants \"cannot reasonably assert that [they are] harmed in any legally cognizable sense by being enjoined from constitutional violations.\"\n\nOn August 7, 2025, the defendants filed a motion in the Supreme Court seeking a stay of the district court's TRO decision. The Administration argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they had not shown a sufficient risk of future unlawful encounters with law enforcement, and that past incidents did not establish such a risk. They claimed the district court order imposed a \u201cstraitjacket\u201d on enforcement that was \u201cinimical to the context- and case-specific totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry\u201d required by the Fourth Amendment, and that the lower court erred in holding that the four prohibited factors\u2014again, apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or accented English, presence at locations where undocumented immigrants gather, and certain jobs like landscaping or construction\u2014could never contribute to reasonable suspicion.

Petitioner Osorto argued his case was extraordinary because he withdrew his TRO request and delayed briefing based on DHS\u2019s promise of a bond hearing, only for DHS to later deny the immigration court\u2019s jurisdiction. After reversing course again, DHS requested a hearing, which was denied for lack of new facts or jurisdictional basis. Osorto also cited serious, persistent health issues, including dizziness, confusion, and a blood pressure reading of 190. The court granted Osorto\u2019s application for release from immigration custody on July 30, 2025. The court found \"special and unusual circumstances,\" citing DHS\u2019s shifting positions, Osorto\u2019s serious health issues, and the immigration court\u2019s repeated refusal to hear the case. The court held it had habeas authority to grant bail, found Osorto neither a danger nor flight risk, and ordered his immediate release on a $5,000 bond with ankle monitoring, declining to stay the order due to his condition.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion to stay the TRO, finding the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits. However, the court agreed with the defendants that the TRO\u2019s clause \u201cexcept as permitted by law\u201d was impermissibly vague and that they were likely to succeed on the merits of that specific challenge.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit found that the individual plaintiffs had standing to seek injunctive relief due to a \"realistic threat\" of being stopped again without reasonable suspicion, as the harm resulted from a \"pattern of officially sanctioned behavior.\" The court noted that in the Central District of California, where the stops occurred and approximately 47 percent of the population is Hispanic or Latino, factors such as apparent race, ethnicity, language, or accent had \"limited probative value\" in establishing reasonable suspicion. The court also concluded that a person\u2019s presence at places like car washes or bus stops, or the type of work they do, did little to arouse reasonable suspicion. Finally, the court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that the TRO would have a \"chilling effect\" on enforcement, finding that defendants \"cannot reasonably assert that [they are] harmed in any legally cognizable sense by being enjoined from constitutional violations.\"\n\nOn August 7, 2025, the defendants filed a motion in the Supreme Court seeking a stay of the district court's TRO decision. The Administration argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they had not shown a sufficient risk of future unlawful encounters with law enforcement, and that past incidents did not establish such a risk. They claimed the district court order imposed a \u201cstraitjacket\u201d on enforcement that was \u201cinimical to the context- and case-specific totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry\u201d required by the Fourth Amendment, and that the lower court erred in holding that the four prohibited factors\u2014again, apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or accented English, presence at locations where undocumented immigrants gather, and certain jobs like landscaping or construction\u2014could never contribute to reasonable suspicion. They argued that actually race, ethnicity, language, etc. were appropriate factors for reasonable suspicion, but complained that under the order:\n\nThe only safe harbor for an immigration agent in the Central District of California would be to ignore the apparent race or ethnicity, language, location, and occupation of a suspected illegal alien\u2014and thus to ignore factors that may often support reasonable suspicion in context.\n\nThey further argued that the district-wide injunction violated Trump v. CASA, Inc. (24A884), which barred such sweeping relief, noting that the August 1 order applied to all 20 million residents of the Central District rather than just the named respondents, and that it inflicted \u201cmanifest irreparable harm\u201d by hindering enforcement and making every stop a potential \u201ccontempt trap.\u201d\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) filed an amicus brief supporting the stay, arguing that the injunction misapplied the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonable suspicion standard. FAIR emphasized that temporary investigative stops required only reasonable suspicion, a lower threshold than probable cause, as established in Terry v. Ohio and reinforced in Kansas v. Glover.\n\nOn the same day, the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, and 20 other cities in the Central District of California filed an amicus brief opposing the stay. They contested the applicants\u2019 claim that \u201capparent ethnicity\u201d and language could justify stops and detentions, noting that applying this standard would have subjected over half of the Central District\u2019s population, including millions of U.S. citizens, to detention. They further argued that the applicants\u2019 unconstitutional actions had harmed communities by diverting local law enforcement resources, reducing public cooperation, and deterring victims and witnesses from participating in the justice system.\n\nThis case remains active at all three levels of federal court: In the Central District of California, briefing proceeds on a preliminary injunction (with a hearing scheduled for September 24, 2025), and class certification.\u00a0 In the Ninth Circuit, the TRO appeal is pending. And in the Supreme Court, stay briefing concluded on August 13.",
    "target_paragraph": "On July 11, 2025, Judge Frimpong granted a temporary restraining order and order to show cause regarding a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1915964. The court concluded that the petitioners were likely to succeed in showing that the defendants had conducted roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and had denied access to lawyers, in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, respectively. The court also highlighted restricted access to counsel for individuals detained at B-18, noting that attorneys and legal representatives were often denied entry or permitted only brief, limited visits. Accordingly, the court ordered the defendants to cease these practices, specifically prohibiting federal agents from conducting detentive stops without reasonable suspicion of an immigration violation and forbidding reliance solely on four factors (alone or in combination): the district court temporarily enjoined the government from stopping people based only on four factors, alone or in combination: \u00a0race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or accented English; presence in certain kinds of locations frequented by the public, like bus stops, car washes, and parking lots; and type of occupation. \u00a0The order further required immigration agencies to provide detainees with access to attorneys or legal representatives seven days a week, including confidential, unmonitored telephone calls at no charge.",

    "target": "On June 6, 2025, federal law enforcement arrived in Los Angeles to launch what Trump Administration officials described as \u201cthe largest Mass Deportation Operation in History.\u201d This case challenges the enforcement practices used during that operation, focusing specifically on the use of roving patrols. Petitioners alleged that federal agents conducted indiscriminate roundups without reasonable suspicion, often appearing masked, without visible badges or identification, and without identifying their agency. These patrols were further alleged to have based detentive stops not on individualized suspicion but on factors such as race, ethnicity, accent, or presence at day laborer sites, bus stops, car washes, or agricultural locations. Certain case documents, including the original petition, have not been made publicly available.\n\nOn June 18, 2025, in Pasadena, California, several individuals were arrested while waiting for a job and subsequently detained in the basement of the Los Angeles federal building (B-18), where they reported experiencing dungeon-like conditions, crowded, unsanitary conditions with limited access to basic necessities and medical care, and were denied phone calls.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, these individuals, along with Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, and organizations such as the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, United Farm Workers, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, and Immigrant Defenders Law Center, filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The petitioners sued the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of a regional ICE field office, the U.S. Attorney General, and various other federal officials from agencies including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Border Patrol, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The case was assigned to District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong and referred to Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym.\n\nRepresented by attorneys and legal representatives from the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) and Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), the petitioners sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. They argued that the defendants\u2019 operation involved two unconstitutional features: \u201croving patrols\u201d indiscriminately rounding up numerous individuals without reasonable suspicion and denying these individuals access to lawyers, which they contended violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution, respectively.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the petitioners filed a first amended complaint and an application for a temporary restraining order concerning access to counsel. The next day, on July 3, 2025, they filed a second application for a temporary restraining order focusing on unlawful stops.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, Judge Frimpong granted a temporary restraining order and order to show cause regarding a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1915964. The court concluded that the petitioners were likely to succeed in showing that the defendants had conducted roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and had denied access to lawyers, in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, respectively. The court also highlighted restricted access to counsel for individuals detained at B-18, noting that attorneys and legal representatives were often denied entry or permitted only brief, limited visits. Accordingly, the court ordered the defendants to cease these practices, specifically prohibiting federal agents from conducting detentive stops without reasonable suspicion of an immigration violation and forbidding reliance solely on four factors (alone or in combination): the district court temporarily enjoined the government from stopping people based only on four factors, alone or in combination: \u00a0race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or accented English; presence in certain kinds of locations frequented by the public, like bus stops, car washes, and parking lots; and type of occupation. \u00a0The order further required immigration agencies to provide detainees with access to attorneys or legal representatives seven days a week, including confidential, unmonitored telephone calls at no charge.\n\nOn July 13, 2025, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On July 14, 2025, they filed a motion to stay the district court\u2019s TRO pending appeal. On July 16, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motions to stay the district court\u2019s injunction pending appeal, without prejudice. The court found that DHS and other defendants failed to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8 because they neither sought a stay pending appeal from the district court nor showed that doing so was impracticable.\n\nBack in the district court, petitioner Carlos Osorto filed an application for release from immigration custody on July 21, 2025. Petitioner Osorto argued his case was extraordinary because he withdrew his TRO request and delayed briefing based on DHS\u2019s promise of a bond hearing, only for DHS to later deny the immigration court\u2019s jurisdiction. After reversing course again, DHS requested a hearing, which was denied for lack of new facts or jurisdictional basis. Osorto also cited serious, persistent health issues, including dizziness, confusion, and a blood pressure reading of 190. The court granted Osorto\u2019s application for release from immigration custody on July 30, 2025. The court found \"special and unusual circumstances,\" citing DHS\u2019s shifting positions, Osorto\u2019s serious health issues, and the immigration court\u2019s repeated refusal to hear the case. The court held it had habeas authority to grant bail, found Osorto neither a danger nor flight risk, and ordered his immediate release on a $5,000 bond with ankle monitoring, declining to stay the order due to his condition.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion to stay the TRO, finding the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits. However, the court agreed with the defendants that the TRO\u2019s clause \u201cexcept as permitted by law\u201d was impermissibly vague and that they were likely to succeed on the merits of that specific challenge.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit found that the individual plaintiffs had standing to seek injunctive relief due to a \"realistic threat\" of being stopped again without reasonable suspicion, as the harm resulted from a \"pattern of officially sanctioned behavior.\" The court noted that in the Central District of California, where the stops occurred and approximately 47 percent of the population is Hispanic or Latino, factors such as apparent race, ethnicity, language, or accent had \"limited probative value\" in establishing reasonable suspicion. The court also concluded that a person\u2019s presence at places like car washes or bus stops, or the type of work they do, did little to arouse reasonable suspicion. Finally, the court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that the TRO would have a \"chilling effect\" on enforcement, finding that defendants \"cannot reasonably assert that [they are] harmed in any legally cognizable sense by being enjoined from constitutional violations.\"\n\nOn August 7, 2025, the defendants filed a motion in the Supreme Court seeking a stay of the district court's TRO decision.

They argued that actually race, ethnicity, language, etc. were appropriate factors for reasonable suspicion, but complained that under the order:\n\nThe only safe harbor for an immigration agent in the Central District of California would be to ignore the apparent race or ethnicity, language, location, and occupation of a suspected illegal alien\u2014and thus to ignore factors that may often support reasonable suspicion in context.\n\nThey further argued that the district-wide injunction violated Trump v.

FAIR emphasized that temporary investigative stops required only reasonable suspicion, a lower threshold than probable cause, as established in Terry v. Ohio and reinforced in Kansas v. Glover.\n\nOn the same day, the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, and 20 other cities in the Central District of California filed an amicus brief opposing the stay. They contested the applicants\u2019 claim that \u201capparent ethnicity\u201d and language could justify stops and detentions, noting that applying this standard would have subjected over half of the Central District\u2019s population, including millions of U.S. citizens, to detention. They further argued that the applicants\u2019 unconstitutional actions had harmed communities by diverting local law enforcement resources, reducing public cooperation, and deterring victims and witnesses from participating in the justice system.\n\nThis case remains active at all three levels of federal court: In the Central District of California, briefing proceeds on a preliminary injunction (with a hearing scheduled for September 24, 2025), and class certification.\u00a0 In the Ninth Circuit, the TRO appeal is pending.

    "target": "On June 6, 2025, federal law enforcement arrived in Los Angeles to launch what Trump Administration officials described as \u201cthe largest Mass Deportation Operation in History.\u201d This case challenges the enforcement practices used during that operation, focusing specifically on the use of roving patrols. Petitioners alleged that federal agents conducted indiscriminate roundups without reasonable suspicion, often appearing masked, without visible badges or identification, and without identifying their agency. These patrols were further alleged to have based detentive stops not on individualized suspicion but on factors such as race, ethnicity, accent, or presence at day laborer sites, bus stops, car washes, or agricultural locations. Certain case documents, including the original petition, have not been made publicly available.\n\nOn June 18, 2025, in Pasadena, California, several individuals were arrested while waiting for a job and subsequently detained in the basement of the Los Angeles federal building (B-18), where they reported experiencing dungeon-like conditions, crowded, unsanitary conditions with limited access to basic necessities and medical care, and were denied phone calls.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, these individuals, along with Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, and organizations such as the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, United Farm Workers, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, and Immigrant Defenders Law Center, filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The petitioners sued the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of a regional ICE field office, the U.S. Attorney General, and various other federal officials from agencies including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Border Patrol, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The case was assigned to District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong and referred to Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym.\n\nRepresented by attorneys and legal representatives from the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) and Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), the petitioners sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. They argued that the defendants\u2019 operation involved two unconstitutional features: \u201croving patrols\u201d indiscriminately rounding up numerous individuals without reasonable suspicion and denying these individuals access to lawyers, which they contended violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution, respectively.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the petitioners filed a first amended complaint and an application for a temporary restraining order concerning access to counsel. The next day, on July 3, 2025, they filed a second application for a temporary restraining order focusing on unlawful stops.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, Judge Frimpong granted a temporary restraining order and order to show cause regarding a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1915964. The court concluded that the petitioners were likely to succeed in showing that the defendants had conducted roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and had denied access to lawyers, in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, respectively. The court also highlighted restricted access to counsel for individuals detained at B-18, noting that attorneys and legal representatives were often denied entry or permitted only brief, limited visits. Accordingly, the court ordered the defendants to cease these practices, specifically prohibiting federal agents from conducting detentive stops without reasonable suspicion of an immigration violation and forbidding reliance solely on four factors (alone or in combination): the district court temporarily enjoined the government from stopping people based only on four factors, alone or in combination: \u00a0race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or accented English; presence in certain kinds of locations frequented by the public, like bus stops, car washes, and parking lots; and type of occupation. \u00a0The order further required immigration agencies to provide detainees with access to attorneys or legal representatives seven days a week, including confidential, unmonitored telephone calls at no charge.\n\nOn July 13, 2025, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On July 14, 2025, they filed a motion to stay the district court\u2019s TRO pending appeal. On July 16, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motions to stay the district court\u2019s injunction pending appeal, without prejudice. The court found that DHS and other defendants failed to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8 because they neither sought a stay pending appeal from the district court nor showed that doing so was impracticable.\n\nBack in the district court, petitioner Carlos Osorto filed an application for release from immigration custody on July 21, 2025. Petitioner Osorto argued his case was extraordinary because he withdrew his TRO request and delayed briefing based on DHS\u2019s promise of a bond hearing, only for DHS to later deny the immigration court\u2019s jurisdiction. After reversing course again, DHS requested a hearing, which was denied for lack of new facts or jurisdictional basis. Osorto also cited serious, persistent health issues, including dizziness, confusion, and a blood pressure reading of 190. The court granted Osorto\u2019s application for release from immigration custody on July 30, 2025. The court found \"special and unusual circumstances,\" citing DHS\u2019s shifting positions, Osorto\u2019s serious health issues, and the immigration court\u2019s repeated refusal to hear the case. The court held it had habeas authority to grant bail, found Osorto neither a danger nor flight risk, and ordered his immediate release on a $5,000 bond with ankle monitoring, declining to stay the order due to his condition.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion to stay the TRO, finding the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits. However, the court agreed with the defendants that the TRO\u2019s clause \u201cexcept as permitted by law\u201d was impermissibly vague and that they were likely to succeed on the merits of that specific challenge.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit found that the individual plaintiffs had standing to seek injunctive relief due to a \"realistic threat\" of being stopped again without reasonable suspicion, as the harm resulted from a \"pattern of officially sanctioned behavior.\" The court noted that in the Central District of California, where the stops occurred and approximately 47 percent of the population is Hispanic or Latino, factors such as apparent race, ethnicity, language, or accent had \"limited probative value\" in establishing reasonable suspicion. The court also concluded that a person\u2019s presence at places like car washes or bus stops, or the type of work they do, did little to arouse reasonable suspicion. Finally, the court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that the TRO would have a \"chilling effect\" on enforcement, finding that defendants \"cannot reasonably assert that [they are] harmed in any legally cognizable sense by being enjoined from constitutional violations.\"\n\nOn August 7, 2025, the defendants filed a motion in the Supreme Court seeking a stay of the district court's TRO decision. The Administration argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they had not shown a sufficient risk of future unlawful encounters with law enforcement, and that past incidents did not establish such a risk. They claimed the district court order imposed a \u201cstraitjacket\u201d on enforcement that was \u201cinimical to the context- and case-specific totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry\u201d required by the Fourth Amendment, and that the lower court erred in holding that the four prohibited factors\u2014again, apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or accented English, presence at locations where undocumented immigrants gather, and certain jobs like landscaping or construction\u2014could never contribute to reasonable suspicion. They argued that actually race, ethnicity, language, etc. were appropriate factors for reasonable suspicion, but complained that under the order:\n\nThe only safe harbor for an immigration agent in the Central District of California would be to ignore the apparent race or ethnicity, language, location, and occupation of a suspected illegal alien\u2014and thus to ignore factors that may often support reasonable suspicion in context.\n\nThey further argued that the district-wide injunction violated Trump v. CASA, Inc. (24A884), which barred such sweeping relief, noting that the August 1 order applied to all 20 million residents of the Central District rather than just the named respondents, and that it inflicted \u201cmanifest irreparable harm\u201d by hindering enforcement and making every stop a potential \u201ccontempt trap.\u201d\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) filed an amicus brief supporting the stay, arguing that the injunction misapplied the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonable suspicion standard. FAIR emphasized that temporary investigative stops required only reasonable suspicion, a lower threshold than probable cause, as established in Terry v. Ohio and reinforced in Kansas v. Glover.\n\nOn the same day, the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, and 20 other cities in the Central District of California filed an amicus brief opposing the stay. They contested the applicants\u2019 claim that \u201capparent ethnicity\u201d and language could justify stops and detentions, noting that applying this standard would have subjected over half of the Central District\u2019s population, including millions of U.S. citizens, to detention. They further argued that the applicants\u2019 unconstitutional actions had harmed communities by diverting local law enforcement resources, reducing public cooperation, and deterring victims and witnesses from participating in the justice system.\n\nThis case remains active at all three levels of federal court: In the Central District of California, briefing proceeds on a preliminary injunction (with a hearing scheduled for September 24, 2025), and class certification.\u00a0 In the Ninth Circuit, the TRO appeal is pending. And in the Supreme Court, stay briefing concluded on August 13.",

The case was assigned to District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong and referred to Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym.\n\nRepresented by attorneys and legal representatives from the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) and Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), the petitioners sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. They argued that the defendants\u2019 operation involved two unconstitutional features: \u201croving patrols\u201d indiscriminately rounding up numerous individuals without reasonable suspicion and denying these individuals access to lawyers, which they contended violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution, respectively.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the petitioners filed a first amended complaint and an application for a temporary restraining order concerning access to counsel. The next day, on July 3, 2025, they filed a second application for a temporary restraining order focusing on unlawful stops.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, Judge Frimpong granted a temporary restraining order and order to show cause regarding a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1915964. The court concluded that the petitioners were likely to succeed in showing that the defendants had conducted roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and had denied access to lawyers, in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, respectively. The court also highlighted restricted access to counsel for individuals detained at B-18, noting that attorneys and legal representatives were often denied entry or permitted only brief, limited visits. Accordingly, the court ordered the defendants to cease these practices, specifically prohibiting federal agents from conducting detentive stops without reasonable suspicion of an immigration violation and forbidding reliance solely on four factors (alone or in combination): the district court temporarily enjoined the government from stopping people based only on four factors, alone or in combination: \u00a0race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or accented English; presence in certain kinds of locations frequented by the public, like bus stops, car washes, and parking lots; and type of occupation. \u00a0The order further required immigration agencies to provide detainees with access to attorneys or legal representatives seven days a week, including confidential, unmonitored telephone calls at no charge.\n\nOn July 13, 2025, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On July 14, 2025, they filed a motion to stay the district court\u2019s TRO pending appeal. On July 16, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motions to stay the district court\u2019s injunction pending appeal, without prejudice. The court found that DHS and other defendants failed to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8 because they neither sought a stay pending appeal from the district court nor showed that doing so was impracticable.\n\nBack in the district court, petitioner Carlos Osorto filed an application for release from immigration custody on July 21, 2025. Petitioner Osorto argued his case was extraordinary because he withdrew his TRO request and delayed briefing based on DHS\u2019s promise of a bond hearing, only for DHS to later deny the immigration court\u2019s jurisdiction. After reversing course again, DHS requested a hearing, which was denied for lack of new facts or jurisdictional basis. Osorto also cited serious, persistent health issues, including dizziness, confusion, and a blood pressure reading of 190. The court granted Osorto\u2019s application for release from immigration custody on July 30, 2025. The court found \"special and unusual circumstances,\" citing DHS\u2019s shifting positions, Osorto\u2019s serious health issues, and the immigration court\u2019s repeated refusal to hear the case. The court held it had habeas authority to grant bail, found Osorto neither a danger nor flight risk, and ordered his immediate release on a $5,000 bond with ankle monitoring, declining to stay the order due to his condition.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion to stay the TRO, finding the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits. However, the court agreed with the defendants that the TRO\u2019s clause \u201cexcept as permitted by law\u201d was impermissibly vague and that they were likely to succeed on the merits of that specific challenge.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit found that the individual plaintiffs had standing to seek injunctive relief due to a \"realistic threat\" of being stopped again without reasonable suspicion, as the harm resulted from a \"pattern of officially sanctioned behavior.\" The court noted that in the Central District of California, where the stops occurred and approximately 47 percent of the population is Hispanic or Latino, factors such as apparent race, ethnicity, language, or accent had \"limited probative value\" in establishing reasonable suspicion. The court also concluded that a person\u2019s presence at places like car washes or bus stops, or the type of work they do, did little to arouse reasonable suspicion. Finally, the court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that the TRO would have a \"chilling effect\" on enforcement, finding that defendants \"cannot reasonably assert that [they are] harmed in any legally cognizable sense by being enjoined from constitutional violations.\"\n\nOn August 7, 2025, the defendants filed a motion in the Supreme Court seeking a stay of the district court's TRO decision. The Administration argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they had not shown a sufficient risk of future unlawful encounters with law enforcement, and that past incidents did not establish such a risk. They claimed the district court order imposed a \u201cstraitjacket\u201d on enforcement that was \u201cinimical to the context- and case-specific totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry\u201d required by the Fourth Amendment, and that the lower court erred in holding that the four prohibited factors\u2014again, apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or accented English, presence at locations where undocumented immigrants gather, and certain jobs like landscaping or construction\u2014could never contribute to reasonable suspicion. They argued that actually race, ethnicity, language, etc. were appropriate factors for reasonable suspicion, but complained that under the order:\n\nThe only safe harbor for an immigration agent in the Central District of California would be to ignore the apparent race or ethnicity, language, location, and occupation of a suspected illegal alien\u2014and thus to ignore factors that may often support reasonable suspicion in context.\n\nThey further argued that the district-wide injunction violated Trump v. CASA, Inc. (24A884), which barred such sweeping relief, noting that the August 1 order applied to all 20 million residents of the Central District rather than just the named respondents, and that it inflicted \u201cmanifest irreparable harm\u201d by hindering enforcement and making every stop a potential \u201ccontempt trap.\u201d\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) filed an amicus brief supporting the stay, arguing that the injunction misapplied the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonable suspicion standard. FAIR emphasized that temporary investigative stops required only reasonable suspicion, a lower threshold than probable cause, as established in Terry v. Ohio and reinforced in Kansas v. Glover.\n\nOn the same day, the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, and 20 other cities in the Central District of California filed an amicus brief opposing the stay. They contested the applicants\u2019 claim that \u201capparent ethnicity\u201d and language could justify stops and detentions, noting that applying this standard would have subjected over half of the Central District\u2019s population, including millions of U.S. citizens, to detention. They further argued that the applicants\u2019 unconstitutional actions had harmed communities by diverting local law enforcement resources, reducing public cooperation, and deterring victims and witnesses from participating in the justice system.\n\nThis case remains active at all three levels of federal court: In the Central District of California, briefing proceeds on a preliminary injunction (with a hearing scheduled for September 24, 2025), and class certification.\u00a0 In the Ninth Circuit, the TRO appeal is pending. And in the Supreme Court, stay briefing concluded on August 13.",

    "target": "On June 6, 2025, federal law enforcement arrived in Los Angeles to launch what Trump Administration officials described as \u201cthe largest Mass Deportation Operation in History.\u201d This case challenges the enforcement practices used during that operation, focusing specifically on the use of roving patrols. Petitioners alleged that federal agents conducted indiscriminate roundups without reasonable suspicion, often appearing masked, without visible badges or identification, and without identifying their agency. These patrols were further alleged to have based detentive stops not on individualized suspicion but on factors such as race, ethnicity, accent, or presence at day laborer sites, bus stops, car washes, or agricultural locations.

The case was assigned to District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong and referred to Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym.\n\nRepresented by attorneys and legal representatives from the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) and Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), the petitioners sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. They argued that the defendants\u2019 operation involved two unconstitutional features: \u201croving patrols\u201d indiscriminately rounding up numerous individuals without reasonable suspicion and denying these individuals access to lawyers, which they contended violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution, respectively.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the petitioners filed a first amended complaint and an application for a temporary restraining order concerning access to counsel.

The court concluded that the petitioners were likely to succeed in showing that the defendants had conducted roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and had denied access to lawyers, in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, respectively. The court also highlighted restricted access to counsel for individuals detained at B-18, noting that attorneys and legal representatives were often denied entry or permitted only brief, limited visits. Accordingly, the court ordered the defendants to cease these practices, specifically prohibiting federal agents from conducting detentive stops without reasonable suspicion of an immigration violation and forbidding reliance solely on four factors (alone or in combination): the district court temporarily enjoined the government from stopping people based only on four factors, alone or in combination: \u00a0race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or accented English; presence in certain kinds of locations frequented by the public, like bus stops, car washes, and parking lots; and type of occupation. \u00a0The order further required immigration agencies to provide detainees with access to attorneys or legal representatives seven days a week, including confidential, unmonitored telephone calls at no charge.\n\nOn July 13, 2025, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On July 14, 2025, they filed a motion to stay the district court\u2019s TRO pending appeal. On July 16, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motions to stay the district court\u2019s injunction pending appeal, without prejudice. The court found that DHS and other defendants failed to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8 because they neither sought a stay pending appeal from the district court nor showed that doing so was impracticable.\n\nBack in the district court, petitioner Carlos Osorto filed an application for release from immigration custody on July 21, 2025. Petitioner Osorto argued his case was extraordinary because he withdrew his TRO request and delayed briefing based on DHS\u2019s promise of a bond hearing, only for DHS to later deny the immigration court\u2019s jurisdiction. After reversing course again, DHS requested a hearing, which was denied for lack of new facts or jurisdictional basis. Osorto also cited serious, persistent health issues, including dizziness, confusion, and a blood pressure reading of 190. The court granted Osorto\u2019s application for release from immigration custody on July 30, 2025. The court found \"special and unusual circumstances,\" citing DHS\u2019s shifting positions, Osorto\u2019s serious health issues, and the immigration court\u2019s repeated refusal to hear the case. The court held it had habeas authority to grant bail, found Osorto neither a danger nor flight risk, and ordered his immediate release on a $5,000 bond with ankle monitoring, declining to stay the order due to his condition.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion to stay the TRO, finding the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits. However, the court agreed with the defendants that the TRO\u2019s clause \u201cexcept as permitted by law\u201d was impermissibly vague and that they were likely to succeed on the merits of that specific challenge.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit found that the individual plaintiffs had standing to seek injunctive relief due to a \"realistic threat\" of being stopped again without reasonable suspicion, as the harm resulted from a \"pattern of officially sanctioned behavior.\" The court noted that in the Central District of California, where the stops occurred and approximately 47 percent of the population is Hispanic or Latino, factors such as apparent race, ethnicity, language, or accent had \"limited probative value\" in establishing reasonable suspicion. The court also concluded that a person\u2019s presence at places like car washes or bus stops, or the type of work they do, did little to arouse reasonable suspicion. Finally, the court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that the TRO would have a \"chilling effect\" on enforcement, finding that defendants \"cannot reasonably assert that [they are] harmed in any legally cognizable sense by being enjoined from constitutional violations.\"\n\nOn August 7, 2025, the defendants filed a motion in the Supreme Court seeking a stay of the district court's TRO decision. The Administration argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they had not shown a sufficient risk of future unlawful encounters with law enforcement, and that past incidents did not establish such a risk. They claimed the district court order imposed a \u201cstraitjacket\u201d on enforcement that was \u201cinimical to the context- and case-specific totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry\u201d required by the Fourth Amendment, and that the lower court erred in holding that the four prohibited factors\u2014again, apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or accented English, presence at locations where undocumented immigrants gather, and certain jobs like landscaping or construction\u2014could never contribute to reasonable suspicion. They argued that actually race, ethnicity, language, etc. were appropriate factors for reasonable suspicion, but complained that under the order:\n\nThe only safe harbor for an immigration agent in the Central District of California would be to ignore the apparent race or ethnicity, language, location, and occupation of a suspected illegal alien\u2014and thus to ignore factors that may often support reasonable suspicion in context.\n\nThey further argued that the district-wide injunction violated Trump v. CASA, Inc. (24A884), which barred such sweeping relief, noting that the August 1 order applied to all 20 million residents of the Central District rather than just the named respondents, and that it inflicted \u201cmanifest irreparable harm\u201d by hindering enforcement and making every stop a potential \u201ccontempt trap.\u201d\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) filed an amicus brief supporting the stay, arguing that the injunction misapplied the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonable suspicion standard. FAIR emphasized that temporary investigative stops required only reasonable suspicion, a lower threshold than probable cause, as established in Terry v. Ohio and reinforced in Kansas v. Glover.\n\nOn the same day, the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, and 20 other cities in the Central District of California filed an amicus brief opposing the stay. They contested the applicants\u2019 claim that \u201capparent ethnicity\u201d and language could justify stops and detentions, noting that applying this standard would have subjected over half of the Central District\u2019s population, including millions of U.S. citizens, to detention. They further argued that the applicants\u2019 unconstitutional actions had harmed communities by diverting local law enforcement resources, reducing public cooperation, and deterring victims and witnesses from participating in the justice system.\n\nThis case remains active at all three levels of federal court: In the Central District of California, briefing proceeds on a preliminary injunction (with a hearing scheduled for September 24, 2025), and class certification.\u00a0 In the Ninth Circuit, the TRO appeal is pending. And in the Supreme Court, stay briefing concluded on August 13.",

    "target": "On June 6, 2025, federal law enforcement arrived in Los Angeles to launch what Trump Administration officials described as \u201cthe largest Mass Deportation Operation in History.\u201d This case challenges the enforcement practices used during that operation, focusing specifically on the use of roving patrols. Petitioners alleged that federal agents conducted indiscriminate roundups without reasonable suspicion, often appearing masked, without visible badges or identification, and without identifying their agency. These patrols were further alleged to have based detentive stops not on individualized suspicion but on factors such as race, ethnicity, accent, or presence at day laborer sites, bus stops, car washes, or agricultural locations. Certain case documents, including the original petition, have not been made publicly available.\n\nOn June 18, 2025, in Pasadena, California, several individuals were arrested while waiting for a job and subsequently detained in the basement of the Los Angeles federal building (B-18), where they reported experiencing dungeon-like conditions, crowded, unsanitary conditions with limited access to basic necessities and medical care, and were denied phone calls.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, these individuals, along with Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, and organizations such as the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, United Farm Workers, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, and Immigrant Defenders Law Center, filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The petitioners sued the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of a regional ICE field office, the U.S. Attorney General, and various other federal officials from agencies including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Border Patrol, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The case was assigned to District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong and referred to Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym.\n\nRepresented by attorneys and legal representatives from the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) and Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), the petitioners sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. They argued that the defendants\u2019 operation involved two unconstitutional features: \u201croving patrols\u201d indiscriminately rounding up numerous individuals without reasonable suspicion and denying these individuals access to lawyers, which they contended violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution, respectively.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the petitioners filed a first amended complaint and an application for a temporary restraining order concerning access to counsel. The next day, on July 3, 2025, they filed a second application for a temporary restraining order focusing on unlawful stops.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, Judge Frimpong granted a temporary restraining order and order to show cause regarding a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1915964. The court concluded that the petitioners were likely to succeed in showing that the defendants had conducted roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and had denied access to lawyers, in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, respectively. The court also highlighted restricted access to counsel for individuals detained at B-18, noting that attorneys and legal representatives were often denied entry or permitted only brief, limited visits. Accordingly, the court ordered the defendants to cease these practices, specifically prohibiting federal agents from conducting detentive stops without reasonable suspicion of an immigration violation and forbidding reliance solely on four factors (alone or in combination): the district court temporarily enjoined the government from stopping people based only on four factors, alone or in combination: \u00a0race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or accented English; presence in certain kinds of locations frequented by the public, like bus stops, car washes, and parking lots; and type of occupation. \u00a0The order further required immigration agencies to provide detainees with access to attorneys or legal representatives seven days a week, including confidential, unmonitored telephone calls at no charge.\n\nOn July 13, 2025, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On July 14, 2025, they filed a motion to stay the district court\u2019s TRO pending appeal. On July 16, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motions to stay the district court\u2019s injunction pending appeal, without prejudice.

    "target": "On June 6, 2025, federal law enforcement arrived in Los Angeles to launch what Trump Administration officials described as \u201cthe largest Mass Deportation Operation in History.\u201d This case challenges the enforcement practices used during that operation, focusing specifically on the use of roving patrols. Petitioners alleged that federal agents conducted indiscriminate roundups without reasonable suspicion, often appearing masked, without visible badges or identification, and without identifying their agency. These patrols were further alleged to have based detentive stops not on individualized suspicion but on factors such as race, ethnicity, accent, or presence at day laborer sites, bus stops, car washes, or agricultural locations. Certain case documents, including the original petition, have not been made publicly available.\n\nOn June 18, 2025, in Pasadena, California, several individuals were arrested while waiting for a job and subsequently detained in the basement of the Los Angeles federal building (B-18), where they reported experiencing dungeon-like conditions, crowded, unsanitary conditions with limited access to basic necessities and medical care, and were denied phone calls.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, these individuals, along with Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, and organizations such as the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, United Farm Workers, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, and Immigrant Defenders Law Center, filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The petitioners sued the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of a regional ICE field office, the U.S. Attorney General, and various other federal officials from agencies including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Border Patrol, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The case was assigned to District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong and referred to Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym.\n\nRepresented by attorneys and legal representatives from the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) and Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), the petitioners sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. They argued that the defendants\u2019 operation involved two unconstitutional features: \u201croving patrols\u201d indiscriminately rounding up numerous individuals without reasonable suspicion and denying these individuals access to lawyers, which they contended violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution, respectively.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the petitioners filed a first amended complaint and an application for a temporary restraining order concerning access to counsel. The next day, on July 3, 2025, they filed a second application for a temporary restraining order focusing on unlawful stops.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, Judge Frimpong granted a temporary restraining order and order to show cause regarding a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1915964. The court concluded that the petitioners were likely to succeed in showing that the defendants had conducted roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and had denied access to lawyers, in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, respectively. The court also highlighted restricted access to counsel for individuals detained at B-18, noting that attorneys and legal representatives were often denied entry or permitted only brief, limited visits. Accordingly, the court ordered the defendants to cease these practices, specifically prohibiting federal agents from conducting detentive stops without reasonable suspicion of an immigration violation and forbidding reliance solely on four factors (alone or in combination): the district court temporarily enjoined the government from stopping people based only on four factors, alone or in combination: \u00a0race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or accented English; presence in certain kinds of locations frequented by the public, like bus stops, car washes, and parking lots; and type of occupation. \u00a0The order further required immigration agencies to provide detainees with access to attorneys or legal representatives seven days a week, including confidential, unmonitored telephone calls at no charge.\n\nOn July 13, 2025, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On July 14, 2025, they filed a motion to stay the district court\u2019s TRO pending appeal. On July 16, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motions to stay the district court\u2019s injunction pending appeal, without prejudice. The court found that DHS and other defendants failed to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8 because they neither sought a stay pending appeal from the district court nor showed that doing so was impracticable.\n\nBack in the district court, petitioner Carlos Osorto filed an application for release from immigration custody on July 21, 2025. Petitioner Osorto argued his case was extraordinary because he withdrew his TRO request and delayed briefing based on DHS\u2019s promise of a bond hearing, only for DHS to later deny the immigration court\u2019s jurisdiction. After reversing course again, DHS requested a hearing, which was denied for lack of new facts or jurisdictional basis. Osorto also cited serious, persistent health issues, including dizziness, confusion, and a blood pressure reading of 190. The court granted Osorto\u2019s application for release from immigration custody on July 30, 2025. The court found \"special and unusual circumstances,\" citing DHS\u2019s shifting positions, Osorto\u2019s serious health issues, and the immigration court\u2019s repeated refusal to hear the case. The court held it had habeas authority to grant bail, found Osorto neither a danger nor flight risk, and ordered his immediate release on a $5,000 bond with ankle monitoring, declining to stay the order due to his condition.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion to stay the TRO, finding the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits. However, the court agreed with the defendants that the TRO\u2019s clause \u201cexcept as permitted by law\u201d was impermissibly vague and that they were likely to succeed on the merits of that specific challenge.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit found that the individual plaintiffs had standing to seek injunctive relief due to a \"realistic threat\" of being stopped again without reasonable suspicion, as the harm resulted from a \"pattern of officially sanctioned behavior.\" The court noted that in the Central District of California, where the stops occurred and approximately 47 percent of the population is Hispanic or Latino, factors such as apparent race, ethnicity, language, or accent had \"limited probative value\" in establishing reasonable suspicion. The court also concluded that a person\u2019s presence at places like car washes or bus stops, or the type of work they do, did little to arouse reasonable suspicion. Finally, the court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that the TRO would have a \"chilling effect\" on enforcement, finding that defendants \"cannot reasonably assert that [they are] harmed in any legally cognizable sense by being enjoined from constitutional violations.\"\n\nOn August 7, 2025, the defendants filed a motion in the Supreme Court seeking a stay of the district court's TRO decision. The Administration argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they had not shown a sufficient risk of future unlawful encounters with law enforcement, and that past incidents did not establish such a risk. They claimed the district court order imposed a \u201cstraitjacket\u201d on enforcement that was \u201cinimical to the context- and case-specific totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry\u201d required by the Fourth Amendment, and that the lower court erred in holding that the four prohibited factors\u2014again, apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or accented English, presence at locations where undocumented immigrants gather, and certain jobs like landscaping or construction\u2014could never contribute to reasonable suspicion. They argued that actually race, ethnicity, language, etc. were appropriate factors for reasonable suspicion, but complained that under the order:\n\nThe only safe harbor for an immigration agent in the Central District of California would be to ignore the apparent race or ethnicity, language, location, and occupation of a suspected illegal alien\u2014and thus to ignore factors that may often support reasonable suspicion in context.\n\nThey further argued that the district-wide injunction violated Trump v. CASA, Inc. (24A884), which barred such sweeping relief, noting that the August 1 order applied to all 20 million residents of the Central District rather than just the named respondents, and that it inflicted \u201cmanifest irreparable harm\u201d by hindering enforcement and making every stop a potential \u201ccontempt trap.\u201d\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) filed an amicus brief supporting the stay, arguing that the injunction misapplied the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonable suspicion standard. FAIR emphasized that temporary investigative stops required only reasonable suspicion, a lower threshold than probable cause, as established in Terry v. Ohio and reinforced in Kansas v. Glover.\n\nOn the same day, the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, and 20 other cities in the Central District of California filed an amicus brief opposing the stay. They contested the applicants\u2019 claim that \u201capparent ethnicity\u201d and language could justify stops and detentions, noting that applying this standard would have subjected over half of the Central District\u2019s population, including millions of U.S. citizens, to detention. They further argued that the applicants\u2019 unconstitutional actions had harmed communities by diverting local law enforcement resources, reducing public cooperation, and deterring victims and witnesses from participating in the justice system.\n\nThis case remains active at all three levels of federal court: In the Central District of California, briefing proceeds on a preliminary injunction (with a hearing scheduled for September 24, 2025), and class certification.\u00a0 In the Ninth Circuit, the TRO appeal is pending. And in the Supreme Court, stay briefing concluded on August 13.",

However, the court agreed with the defendants that the TRO\u2019s clause \u201cexcept as permitted by law\u201d was impermissibly vague and that they were likely to succeed on the merits of that specific challenge.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit found that the individual plaintiffs had standing to seek injunctive relief due to a \"realistic threat\" of being stopped again without reasonable suspicion, as the harm resulted from a \"pattern of officially sanctioned behavior.\" The court noted that in the Central District of California, where the stops occurred and approximately 47 percent of the population is Hispanic or Latino, factors such as apparent race, ethnicity, language, or accent had \"limited probative value\" in establishing reasonable suspicion. The court also concluded that a person\u2019s presence at places like car washes or bus stops, or the type of work they do, did little to arouse reasonable suspicion. Finally, the court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that the TRO would have a \"chilling effect\" on enforcement, finding that defendants \"cannot reasonably assert that [they are] harmed in any legally cognizable sense by being enjoined from constitutional violations.\"\n\nOn August 7, 2025, the defendants filed a motion in the Supreme Court seeking a stay of the district court's TRO decision. The Administration argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they had not shown a sufficient risk of future unlawful encounters with law enforcement, and that past incidents did not establish such a risk. They claimed the district court order imposed a \u201cstraitjacket\u201d on enforcement that was \u201cinimical to the context- and case-specific totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry\u201d required by the Fourth Amendment, and that the lower court erred in holding that the four prohibited factors\u2014again, apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or accented English, presence at locations where undocumented immigrants gather, and certain jobs like landscaping or construction\u2014could never contribute to reasonable suspicion. They argued that actually race, ethnicity, language, etc. were appropriate factors for reasonable suspicion, but complained that under the order:\n\nThe only safe harbor for an immigration agent in the Central District of California would be to ignore the apparent race or ethnicity, language, location, and occupation of a suspected illegal alien\u2014and thus to ignore factors that may often support reasonable suspicion in context.\n\nThey further argued that the district-wide injunction violated Trump v. CASA, Inc. (24A884), which barred such sweeping relief, noting that the August 1 order applied to all 20 million residents of the Central District rather than just the named respondents, and that it inflicted \u201cmanifest irreparable harm\u201d by hindering enforcement and making every stop a potential \u201ccontempt trap.\u201d\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) filed an amicus brief supporting the stay, arguing that the injunction misapplied the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonable suspicion standard. FAIR emphasized that temporary investigative stops required only reasonable suspicion, a lower threshold than probable cause, as established in Terry v. Ohio and reinforced in Kansas v. Glover.\n\nOn the same day, the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, and 20 other cities in the Central District of California filed an amicus brief opposing the stay. They contested the applicants\u2019 claim that \u201capparent ethnicity\u201d and language could justify stops and detentions, noting that applying this standard would have subjected over half of the Central District\u2019s population, including millions of U.S. citizens, to detention. They further argued that the applicants\u2019 unconstitutional actions had harmed communities by diverting local law enforcement resources, reducing public cooperation, and deterring victims and witnesses from participating in the justice system.\n\nThis case remains active at all three levels of federal court: In the Central District of California, briefing proceeds on a preliminary injunction (with a hearing scheduled for September 24, 2025), and class certification.\u00a0 In the Ninth Circuit, the TRO appeal is pending.
