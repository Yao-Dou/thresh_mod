You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 9, 2025, three Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State, and the El Valle Detention Facility, the Texas ICE facility where the petitioners are being held.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the petitioners challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Fernando Rodriguez.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners also filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. The same day the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the Southern District of Texas while the case proceeded. A hearing was held on April 11, after which the Court issued a TRO set to expire on April 25, 2025. In addition, Judge Rodriguez ordered the plaintiffs to file a motion for a preliminary injunction by April 16, with briefing set to conclude on April 23 and a hearing scheduled for April 24, 2025.\n\nOn Thursday, April 24, 2025, Judge Rodriguez held a hearing and extended the TRO to Friday, May 2.\n\nOn Thursday, May 1, Judge Rodriguez first held that a class-like procedure was available under habeas, and then certified a class of Venezuelan aliens, 14 years old or older, who have not been naturalized, who Respondents have designated or in the future designate as alien enemies under [President's March 15 Executive Order], and who are detained or reside in the Southern District of Texas.\"\n\nThen he entered a permanent injunction preventing the government from detaining, transferring, or removing J.A.V., J.G.G., W.G.H., and the members of the certified class, under the Alien Enemies Act and the Executive Order. He held:\n\nWhile the [President's] Proclamation references that TdA members have harmed lives in the United States and engage in crime, the Proclamation does not suggest that they have done so through an organized armed attack, or that Venezuela has threatened or attempted such an attack through TdA members. \u00a0As a result, the Proclamation also falls short of describing a \u201cpredatory incursion\u201d as that concept was understood at the time of the AEA\u2019s enactment. . . . For these reasons, the Court concludes that the President\u2019s invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and, as a result, is unlawful. \u00a0Respondents do not possess the lawful authority under the AEA, and based on the Proclamation, to detain Venezuelan aliens, transfer them within the United States, or remove them from the country.\n\nOn June 27, respondents appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Case No. 25-40400).\n\nThis case is ongoing",

    "target": "This is one of several class action challenges to the Trump Administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act (\"AEA\") to circumvent removal procedures and deport Venezuelan nationals without due process. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 9, 2025, three Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State, and the El Valle Detention Facility, the Texas ICE facility where the petitioners are being held.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the petitioners challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Fernando Rodriguez.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners also filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. The same day the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the Southern District of Texas while the case proceeded. A hearing was held on April 11, after which the Court issued a TRO set to expire on April 25, 2025. In addition, Judge Rodriguez ordered the plaintiffs to file a motion for a preliminary injunction by April 16, with briefing set to conclude on April 23 and a hearing scheduled for April 24, 2025.\n\nOn Thursday, April 24, 2025, Judge Rodriguez held a hearing and extended the TRO to Friday, May 2.\n\nOn Thursday, May 1, Judge Rodriguez first held that a class-like procedure was available under habeas, and then certified a class of Venezuelan aliens, 14 years old or older, who have not been naturalized, who Respondents have designated or in the future designate as alien enemies under [President's March 15 Executive Order], and who are detained or reside in the Southern District of Texas.\"\n\nThen he entered a permanent injunction preventing the government from detaining, transferring, or removing J.A.V., J.G.G., W.G.H., and the members of the certified class, under the Alien Enemies Act and the Executive Order. He held:\n\nWhile the [President's] Proclamation references that TdA members have harmed lives in the United States and engage in crime, the Proclamation does not suggest that they have done so through an organized armed attack, or that Venezuela has threatened or attempted such an attack through TdA members. \u00a0As a result, the Proclamation also falls short of describing a \u201cpredatory incursion\u201d as that concept was understood at the time of the AEA\u2019s enactment. . . . For these reasons, the Court concludes that the President\u2019s invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and, as a result, is unlawful. \u00a0Respondents do not possess the lawful authority under the AEA, and based on the Proclamation, to detain Venezuelan aliens, transfer them within the United States, or remove them from the country.\n\nOn June 27, respondents appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Case No. 25-40400).\n\nThis case is ongoing",

You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 9, 2025, three Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State, and the El Valle Detention Facility, the Texas ICE facility where the petitioners are being held.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the petitioners challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Fernando Rodriguez.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners also filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. The same day the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the Southern District of Texas while the case proceeded. A hearing was held on April 11, after which the Court issued a TRO set to expire on April 25, 2025. In addition, Judge Rodriguez ordered the plaintiffs to file a motion for a preliminary injunction by April 16, with briefing set to conclude on April 23 and a hearing scheduled for April 24, 2025.\n\nOn Thursday, April 24, 2025, Judge Rodriguez held a hearing and extended the TRO to Friday, May 2.\n\nOn Thursday, May 1, Judge Rodriguez first held that a class-like procedure was available under habeas, and then certified a class of Venezuelan aliens, 14 years old or older, who have not been naturalized, who Respondents have designated or in the future designate as alien enemies under [President's March 15 Executive Order], and who are detained or reside in the Southern District of Texas.\"\n\nThen he entered a permanent injunction preventing the government from detaining, transferring, or removing J.A.V., J.G.G., W.G.H., and the members of the certified class, under the Alien Enemies Act and the Executive Order. He held:\n\nWhile the [President's] Proclamation references that TdA members have harmed lives in the United States and engage in crime, the Proclamation does not suggest that they have done so through an organized armed attack, or that Venezuela has threatened or attempted such an attack through TdA members. \u00a0As a result, the Proclamation also falls short of describing a \u201cpredatory incursion\u201d as that concept was understood at the time of the AEA\u2019s enactment. . . . For these reasons, the Court concludes that the President\u2019s invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and, as a result, is unlawful. \u00a0Respondents do not possess the lawful authority under the AEA, and based on the Proclamation, to detain Venezuelan aliens, transfer them within the United States, or remove them from the country.\n\nOn June 27, respondents appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Case No. 25-40400).\n\nThis case is ongoing",

You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 9, 2025, three Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State, and the El Valle Detention Facility, the Texas ICE facility where the petitioners are being held.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the petitioners challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Fernando Rodriguez.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners also filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. The same day the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the Southern District of Texas while the case proceeded. A hearing was held on April 11, after which the Court issued a TRO set to expire on April 25, 2025. In addition, Judge Rodriguez ordered the plaintiffs to file a motion for a preliminary injunction by April 16, with briefing set to conclude on April 23 and a hearing scheduled for April 24, 2025.\n\nOn Thursday, April 24, 2025, Judge Rodriguez held a hearing and extended the TRO to Friday, May 2.\n\nOn Thursday, May 1, Judge Rodriguez first held that a class-like procedure was available under habeas, and then certified a class of Venezuelan aliens, 14 years old or older, who have not been naturalized, who Respondents have designated or in the future designate as alien enemies under [President's March 15 Executive Order], and who are detained or reside in the Southern District of Texas.\"\n\nThen he entered a permanent injunction preventing the government from detaining, transferring, or removing J.A.V., J.G.G., W.G.H., and the members of the certified class, under the Alien Enemies Act and the Executive Order. He held:\n\nWhile the [President's] Proclamation references that TdA members have harmed lives in the United States and engage in crime, the Proclamation does not suggest that they have done so through an organized armed attack, or that Venezuela has threatened or attempted such an attack through TdA members. \u00a0As a result, the Proclamation also falls short of describing a \u201cpredatory incursion\u201d as that concept was understood at the time of the AEA\u2019s enactment. . . . For these reasons, the Court concludes that the President\u2019s invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and, as a result, is unlawful. \u00a0Respondents do not possess the lawful authority under the AEA, and based on the Proclamation, to detain Venezuelan aliens, transfer them within the United States, or remove them from the country.\n\nOn June 27, respondents appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Case No. 25-40400).\n\nThis case is ongoing",
