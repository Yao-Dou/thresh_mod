On January 25, 2025, Organized Communities Against Deportation, Brighton Park Neighborhood Council, Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, and Raise the Floor Alliance filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. These plaintiffs are Chicago-based organizations that provide support to immigrant communities and are leaders in the national Sanctuary City Movement. They brought this action against the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and ICE under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 (Declaration of Rights), and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), (B) (The Administrative Procedure Act). Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the federal actions here, including plans for ICE to raid Chicago and \u201csquash the Sanctuary City Movement,\u201d constituted a violation of Plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights, an injunction permanently enjoining Defendants from threatening and/or executing Chicago-based immigration raids, and an order setting aside the Defendant\u2019s policy to conduct immigration raids in Chicago for the purpose of targeting and ultimately destroying the Sanctuary City Movement.\n\nOn that same day, Plaintiffs also filed a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order to enjoin Defendants from threatening and/or executing Chicago-based immigration raids, claiming that they and the communities they represented would be irreparably harmed. Honorable Edmond E. Chang served as emergency judge before the case was assigned to the Honorable John F. Kness and the Honorable M. David Weisman as magistrate judge.\n\nIn an amended complaint, filed on January 26, 2025, Plaintiffs added the President of the U.S., new Secretary of DHS, Acting Deputy Attorney General, Border Czar, DHS, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) as Defendants in the lawsuit.\n\nHowever, on January 29, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a request for leave to withdraw pending motions for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on the basis that the status quo had changed because Defendants had launched ongoing Chicago-based immigration enforcement raids on January 26, 2025. This motion was granted by Judge Kness on January 29, 2025.\n\nOn February 26, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a notice of Voluntary Dismissal, citing the above mentioned change in circumstances. The next day, on February 27, 2025, Judge Kness dismissed the case without prejudice.",

On January 25, 2025, Organized Communities Against Deportation, Brighton Park Neighborhood Council, Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, and Raise the Floor Alliance filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. These plaintiffs are Chicago-based organizations that provide support to immigrant communities and are leaders in the national Sanctuary City Movement. They brought this action against the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and ICE under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 (Declaration of Rights), and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), (B) (The Administrative Procedure Act). Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the federal actions here, including plans for ICE to raid Chicago and \u201csquash the Sanctuary City Movement,\u201d constituted a violation of Plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights, an injunction permanently enjoining Defendants from threatening and/or executing Chicago-based immigration raids, and an order setting aside the Defendant\u2019s policy to conduct immigration raids in Chicago for the purpose of targeting and ultimately destroying the Sanctuary City Movement.\n\nOn that same day, Plaintiffs also filed a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order to enjoin Defendants from threatening and/or executing Chicago-based immigration raids, claiming that they and the communities they represented would be irreparably harmed. Honorable Edmond E. Chang served as emergency judge before the case was assigned to the Honorable John F. Kness and the Honorable M. David Weisman as magistrate judge.\n\nIn an amended complaint, filed on January 26, 2025, Plaintiffs added the President of the U.S., new Secretary of DHS, Acting Deputy Attorney General, Border Czar, DHS, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) as Defendants in the lawsuit.\n\nHowever, on January 29, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a request for leave to withdraw pending motions for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on the basis that the status quo had changed because Defendants had launched ongoing Chicago-based immigration enforcement raids on January 26, 2025. This motion was granted by Judge Kness on January 29, 2025.\n\nOn February 26, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a notice of Voluntary Dismissal, citing the above mentioned change in circumstances.

    "target": "This is a case about sanctuary city policies in Illinois. On January 25, 2025, Organized Communities Against Deportation, Brighton Park Neighborhood Council, Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, and Raise the Floor Alliance filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. These plaintiffs are Chicago-based organizations that provide support to immigrant communities and are leaders in the national Sanctuary City Movement. They brought this action against the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and ICE under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 (Declaration of Rights), and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), (B) (The Administrative Procedure Act). Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the federal actions here, including plans for ICE to raid Chicago and \u201csquash the Sanctuary City Movement,\u201d constituted a violation of Plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights, an injunction permanently enjoining Defendants from threatening and/or executing Chicago-based immigration raids, and an order setting aside the Defendant\u2019s policy to conduct immigration raids in Chicago for the purpose of targeting and ultimately destroying the Sanctuary City Movement.\n\nOn that same day, Plaintiffs also filed a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order to enjoin Defendants from threatening and/or executing Chicago-based immigration raids, claiming that they and the communities they represented would be irreparably harmed. Honorable Edmond E. Chang served as emergency judge before the case was assigned to the Honorable John F. Kness and the Honorable M. David Weisman as magistrate judge.\n\nIn an amended complaint, filed on January 26, 2025, Plaintiffs added the President of the U.S., new Secretary of DHS, Acting Deputy Attorney General, Border Czar, DHS, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) as Defendants in the lawsuit.\n\nHowever, on January 29, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a request for leave to withdraw pending motions for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on the basis that the status quo had changed because Defendants had launched ongoing Chicago-based immigration enforcement raids on January 26, 2025. This motion was granted by Judge Kness on January 29, 2025.\n\nOn February 26, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a notice of Voluntary Dismissal, citing the above mentioned change in circumstances. The next day, on February 27, 2025, Judge Kness dismissed the case without prejudice.",
