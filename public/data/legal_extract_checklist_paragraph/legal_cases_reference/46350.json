    "target": "On April 7, 2025, the American Library Association (ALA) and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (AFSCME) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to dismantle the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), a federal agency tasked with supporting library and museum services nationwide. The defendants include the Institute of Museum and Library Services and its Acting Director, President Trump, DOGE, and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget and its Director.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14238, titled \u201cContinuing Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy,\" and signed on March 14, 2025, which directed the Institute of Museum and Library Services and other federal agencies to eliminate all programs and terminate all staff not required by statute. After the EO was issued, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gutted the Institute of Museum and Library Services, terminating nearly all employees and canceling its grants. The plaintiffs allege that the defendant's actions violated the Separation of Powers, the Take Care Clause, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the First Amendment. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the dismantling of IMLS, reinstate its grants and staff, restore agency functions and access to appropriated funds, and bar the defendants from dissolving IMLS absent Congress's authorization. The case is assigned to District Judge Richard J. Leon.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction; the court decided to consider a temporary restraining order first, while it consider the preliminary injunction request.\u00a0 After a hearing on April 30, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order on May 1, finding:\n\n\"the wholesale termination of grants and services and the mass layoffs appear to violate the clear statutory mandates outlined in the MLSA [Museum and Library Services Act] See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 9103(a)(3) (The Director \"shall be appointed from among individuals who have special competence with regard to library and information services\" or \"special competence with regard to museum services\"); id. \u00a7 9108(a) (\"The Director shall regularly support and conduct, as appropriate, policy research, data collection, analysis and modeling, evaluation, and dissemination of information to extend and improve the Nation's museum, library, and information services.\"); id.\u00a7 9131(b) (\"From the sums appropriated ... the Director shall award grants from minimum allotments [ of $680,000] . . . to each State.\"); id. \u00a7 9161 (\"[T]he Director shall award grants to Indian tribes and to organizations that primarily serve and represent Native Hawaiians.\"); id. \u00a7 9162(a) (\"[T]he Director shall establish and carry out a program to enhance the quality of library services nationwide and to provide coordination between libraries and museums .... \"). Moreover, defendants' conduct contravenes Congress's appropriation of almost $300 million to IMLS. Plaintiffs are therefore likely to succeed in showing that defendants' actions to unilaterally shutter IMLS violate, at minimum, the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nMoreover, the court found that plaintiffs have provided evidence of significant and irreparable injury -- \"that the grant terminations, loss of access to IMLS expertise and services, and loss of access to IMLS data have forced libraries to end programs midstream, fire employees, and, in some cases, completely shutter.\"\n\nAccordingly, the court enjoined any further diminution of MLS's capacity while the preliminary injunction request was pending. On May 6, defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's TRO order, citing the D.C. Circuit's May 3 decision to stay an analogous order in a similar case, Widakuswara v. Lake. [../../../../case/46275/]\n\nThe following day, the court extended the TRO until May 29 to allow additional time for briefing and argument.\n\nOn May 21, the court noted that the D.C. Circuit's pending en banc review in Widakuswara involved issues directly relevant to this case. To avoid issuing a premature ruling on the PI, the court ordered the parties to indicate by May 23, 2025, whether they consented to extending the TRO pending resolution of the injunction motion. The parties submitted their respective responses, with defendants objecting to the extension and plaintiffs consenting to it. The TRO expired on May 29, 2025.\n\nOn June 2, plaintiffs filed a motion for a narrow TRO prohibiting defendants from further pausing, canceling, or otherwise terminating IMLS grants or contracts, or from withholding disbursement of funds in accordance with such grants or contracts. In the alternative, plaintiffs requested that the court rule on their motion for a PI within seven days.\n\nOn June 6, the court denied plaintiffs' motion for a PI, citing recent indications from the Supreme Court and Circuit Judges that actions seeking reinstatement of federal grants fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims rather than the district courts. It further ordered the parties to file a joint status report proposing next steps by June 13, 2025, and denied plaintiffs' June 2 motion as moot.\n\nThe parties filed a joint status report on June 13, outlining defendants' intention to file a motion to dismiss and plaintiffs' proposal to proceed with expedited summary judgment briefing.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "On April 7, 2025, the American Library Association (ALA) and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (AFSCME) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to dismantle the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), a federal agency tasked with supporting library and museum services nationwide. The defendants include the Institute of Museum and Library Services and its Acting Director, President Trump, DOGE, and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget and its Director.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14238, titled \u201cContinuing Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy,\" and signed on March 14, 2025, which directed the Institute of Museum and Library Services and other federal agencies to eliminate all programs and terminate all staff not required by statute. After the EO was issued, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gutted the Institute of Museum and Library Services, terminating nearly all employees and canceling its grants. The plaintiffs allege that the defendant's actions violated the Separation of Powers, the Take Care Clause, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the First Amendment. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the dismantling of IMLS, reinstate its grants and staff, restore agency functions and access to appropriated funds, and bar the defendants from dissolving IMLS absent Congress's authorization. The case is assigned to District Judge Richard J. Leon.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction; the court decided to consider a temporary restraining order first, while it consider the preliminary injunction request.\u00a0 After a hearing on April 30, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order on May 1, finding:\n\n\"the wholesale termination of grants and services and the mass layoffs appear to violate the clear statutory mandates outlined in the MLSA [Museum and Library Services Act] See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 9103(a)(3) (The Director \"shall be appointed from among individuals who have special competence with regard to library and information services\" or \"special competence with regard to museum services\"); id. \u00a7 9108(a) (\"The Director shall regularly support and conduct, as appropriate, policy research, data collection, analysis and modeling, evaluation, and dissemination of information to extend and improve the Nation's museum, library, and information services.\"); id.\u00a7 9131(b) (\"From the sums appropriated ... the Director shall award grants from minimum allotments [ of $680,000] . . . to each State.\"); id. \u00a7 9161 (\"[T]he Director shall award grants to Indian tribes and to organizations that primarily serve and represent Native Hawaiians.\"); id. \u00a7 9162(a) (\"[T]he Director shall establish and carry out a program to enhance the quality of library services nationwide and to provide coordination between libraries and museums .... \"). Moreover, defendants' conduct contravenes Congress's appropriation of almost $300 million to IMLS. Plaintiffs are therefore likely to succeed in showing that defendants' actions to unilaterally shutter IMLS violate, at minimum, the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nMoreover, the court found that plaintiffs have provided evidence of significant and irreparable injury -- \"that the grant terminations, loss of access to IMLS expertise and services, and loss of access to IMLS data have forced libraries to end programs midstream, fire employees, and, in some cases, completely shutter.\"\n\nAccordingly, the court enjoined any further diminution of MLS's capacity while the preliminary injunction request was pending. On May 6, defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's TRO order, citing the D.C. Circuit's May 3 decision to stay an analogous order in a similar case, Widakuswara v. Lake. [../../../../case/46275/]\n\nThe following day, the court extended the TRO until May 29 to allow additional time for briefing and argument.\n\nOn May 21, the court noted that the D.C. Circuit's pending en banc review in Widakuswara involved issues directly relevant to this case. To avoid issuing a premature ruling on the PI, the court ordered the parties to indicate by May 23, 2025, whether they consented to extending the TRO pending resolution of the injunction motion. The parties submitted their respective responses, with defendants objecting to the extension and plaintiffs consenting to it. The TRO expired on May 29, 2025.\n\nOn June 2, plaintiffs filed a motion for a narrow TRO prohibiting defendants from further pausing, canceling, or otherwise terminating IMLS grants or contracts, or from withholding disbursement of funds in accordance with such grants or contracts. In the alternative, plaintiffs requested that the court rule on their motion for a PI within seven days.\n\nOn June 6, the court denied plaintiffs' motion for a PI, citing recent indications from the Supreme Court and Circuit Judges that actions seeking reinstatement of federal grants fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims rather than the district courts. It further ordered the parties to file a joint status report proposing next steps by June 13, 2025, and denied plaintiffs' June 2 motion as moot.\n\nThe parties filed a joint status report on June 13, outlining defendants' intention to file a motion to dismiss and plaintiffs' proposal to proceed with expedited summary judgment briefing.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

The TRO expired on May 29, 2025.\n\nOn June 2, plaintiffs filed a motion for a narrow TRO prohibiting defendants from further pausing, canceling, or otherwise terminating IMLS grants or contracts, or from withholding disbursement of funds in accordance with such grants or contracts. In the alternative, plaintiffs requested that the court rule on their motion for a PI within seven days.\n\nOn June 6, the court denied plaintiffs' motion for a PI, citing recent indications from the Supreme Court and Circuit Judges that actions seeking reinstatement of federal grants fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims rather than the district courts. It further ordered the parties to file a joint status report proposing next steps by June 13, 2025, and denied plaintiffs' June 2 motion as moot.\n\nThe parties filed a joint status report on June 13, outlining defendants' intention to file a motion to dismiss and plaintiffs' proposal to proceed with expedited summary judgment briefing.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

The defendants include the Institute of Museum and Library Services and its Acting Director, President Trump, DOGE, and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget and its Director.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14238, titled \u201cContinuing Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy,\" and signed on March 14, 2025, which directed the Institute of Museum and Library Services and other federal agencies to eliminate all programs and terminate all staff not required by statute. After the EO was issued, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gutted the Institute of Museum and Library Services, terminating nearly all employees and canceling its grants. The plaintiffs allege that the defendant's actions violated the Separation of Powers, the Take Care Clause, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the First Amendment. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the dismantling of IMLS, reinstate its grants and staff, restore agency functions and access to appropriated funds, and bar the defendants from dissolving IMLS absent Congress's authorization. The case is assigned to District Judge Richard J. Leon.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction; the court decided to consider a temporary restraining order first, while it consider the preliminary injunction request.\u00a0 After a hearing on April 30, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order on May 1, finding:\n\n\"the wholesale termination of grants and services and the mass layoffs appear to violate the clear statutory mandates outlined in the MLSA [Museum and Library Services Act] See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 9103(a)(3) (The Director \"shall be appointed from among individuals who have special competence with regard to library and information services\" or \"special competence with regard to museum services\"); id. \u00a7 9108(a) (\"The Director shall regularly support and conduct, as appropriate, policy research, data collection, analysis and modeling, evaluation, and dissemination of information to extend and improve the Nation's museum, library, and information services.\"); id.\u00a7 9131(b) (\"From the sums appropriated ... the Director shall award grants from minimum allotments [ of $680,000] . . . to each State.\"); id. \u00a7 9161 (\"[T]he Director shall award grants to Indian tribes and to organizations that primarily serve and represent Native Hawaiians.\"); id. \u00a7 9162(a) (\"[T]he Director shall establish and carry out a program to enhance the quality of library services nationwide and to provide coordination between libraries and museums .... \").

    "target": "On April 7, 2025, the American Library Association (ALA) and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (AFSCME) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to dismantle the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), a federal agency tasked with supporting library and museum services nationwide. The defendants include the Institute of Museum and Library Services and its Acting Director, President Trump, DOGE, and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget and its Director.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14238, titled \u201cContinuing Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy,\" and signed on March 14, 2025, which directed the Institute of Museum and Library Services and other federal agencies to eliminate all programs and terminate all staff not required by statute. After the EO was issued, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gutted the Institute of Museum and Library Services, terminating nearly all employees and canceling its grants. The plaintiffs allege that the defendant's actions violated the Separation of Powers, the Take Care Clause, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the First Amendment. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the dismantling of IMLS, reinstate its grants and staff, restore agency functions and access to appropriated funds, and bar the defendants from dissolving IMLS absent Congress's authorization. The case is assigned to District Judge Richard J. Leon.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction; the court decided to consider a temporary restraining order first, while it consider the preliminary injunction request.\u00a0 After a hearing on April 30, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order on May 1, finding:\n\n\"the wholesale termination of grants and services and the mass layoffs appear to violate the clear statutory mandates outlined in the MLSA [Museum and Library Services Act] See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 9103(a)(3) (The Director \"shall be appointed from among individuals who have special competence with regard to library and information services\" or \"special competence with regard to museum services\"); id. \u00a7 9108(a) (\"The Director shall regularly support and conduct, as appropriate, policy research, data collection, analysis and modeling, evaluation, and dissemination of information to extend and improve the Nation's museum, library, and information services.\"); id.\u00a7 9131(b) (\"From the sums appropriated ... the Director shall award grants from minimum allotments [ of $680,000] . . . to each State.\"); id. \u00a7 9161 (\"[T]he Director shall award grants to Indian tribes and to organizations that primarily serve and represent Native Hawaiians.\"); id. \u00a7 9162(a) (\"[T]he Director shall establish and carry out a program to enhance the quality of library services nationwide and to provide coordination between libraries and museums .... \"). Moreover, defendants' conduct contravenes Congress's appropriation of almost $300 million to IMLS. Plaintiffs are therefore likely to succeed in showing that defendants' actions to unilaterally shutter IMLS violate, at minimum, the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nMoreover, the court found that plaintiffs have provided evidence of significant and irreparable injury -- \"that the grant terminations, loss of access to IMLS expertise and services, and loss of access to IMLS data have forced libraries to end programs midstream, fire employees, and, in some cases, completely shutter.\"\n\nAccordingly, the court enjoined any further diminution of MLS's capacity while the preliminary injunction request was pending. On May 6, defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's TRO order, citing the D.C. Circuit's May 3 decision to stay an analogous order in a similar case, Widakuswara v. Lake. [../../../../case/46275/]\n\nThe following day, the court extended the TRO until May 29 to allow additional time for briefing and argument.\n\nOn May 21, the court noted that the D.C. Circuit's pending en banc review in Widakuswara involved issues directly relevant to this case. To avoid issuing a premature ruling on the PI, the court ordered the parties to indicate by May 23, 2025, whether they consented to extending the TRO pending resolution of the injunction motion. The parties submitted their respective responses, with defendants objecting to the extension and plaintiffs consenting to it. The TRO expired on May 29, 2025.\n\nOn June 2, plaintiffs filed a motion for a narrow TRO prohibiting defendants from further pausing, canceling, or otherwise terminating IMLS grants or contracts, or from withholding disbursement of funds in accordance with such grants or contracts. In the alternative, plaintiffs requested that the court rule on their motion for a PI within seven days.\n\nOn June 6, the court denied plaintiffs' motion for a PI, citing recent indications from the Supreme Court and Circuit Judges that actions seeking reinstatement of federal grants fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims rather than the district courts. It further ordered the parties to file a joint status report proposing next steps by June 13, 2025, and denied plaintiffs' June 2 motion as moot.\n\nThe parties filed a joint status report on June 13, outlining defendants' intention to file a motion to dismiss and plaintiffs' proposal to proceed with expedited summary judgment briefing.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "On April 7, 2025, the American Library Association (ALA) and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (AFSCME) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to dismantle the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), a federal agency tasked with supporting library and museum services nationwide. The defendants include the Institute of Museum and Library Services and its Acting Director, President Trump, DOGE, and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget and its Director.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14238, titled \u201cContinuing Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy,\" and signed on March 14, 2025, which directed the Institute of Museum and Library Services and other federal agencies to eliminate all programs and terminate all staff not required by statute. After the EO was issued, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gutted the Institute of Museum and Library Services, terminating nearly all employees and canceling its grants. The plaintiffs allege that the defendant's actions violated the Separation of Powers, the Take Care Clause, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the First Amendment. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the dismantling of IMLS, reinstate its grants and staff, restore agency functions and access to appropriated funds, and bar the defendants from dissolving IMLS absent Congress's authorization. The case is assigned to District Judge Richard J. Leon.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction; the court decided to consider a temporary restraining order first, while it consider the preliminary injunction request.\u00a0 After a hearing on April 30, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order on May 1, finding:\n\n\"the wholesale termination of grants and services and the mass layoffs appear to violate the clear statutory mandates outlined in the MLSA [Museum and Library Services Act] See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 9103(a)(3) (The Director \"shall be appointed from among individuals who have special competence with regard to library and information services\" or \"special competence with regard to museum services\"); id. \u00a7 9108(a) (\"The Director shall regularly support and conduct, as appropriate, policy research, data collection, analysis and modeling, evaluation, and dissemination of information to extend and improve the Nation's museum, library, and information services.\"); id.\u00a7 9131(b) (\"From the sums appropriated ... the Director shall award grants from minimum allotments [ of $680,000] . . . to each State.\"); id. \u00a7 9161 (\"[T]he Director shall award grants to Indian tribes and to organizations that primarily serve and represent Native Hawaiians.\"); id. \u00a7 9162(a) (\"[T]he Director shall establish and carry out a program to enhance the quality of library services nationwide and to provide coordination between libraries and museums .... \"). Moreover, defendants' conduct contravenes Congress's appropriation of almost $300 million to IMLS. Plaintiffs are therefore likely to succeed in showing that defendants' actions to unilaterally shutter IMLS violate, at minimum, the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nMoreover, the court found that plaintiffs have provided evidence of significant and irreparable injury -- \"that the grant terminations, loss of access to IMLS expertise and services, and loss of access to IMLS data have forced libraries to end programs midstream, fire employees, and, in some cases, completely shutter.\"\n\nAccordingly, the court enjoined any further diminution of MLS's capacity while the preliminary injunction request was pending. On May 6, defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's TRO order, citing the D.C. Circuit's May 3 decision to stay an analogous order in a similar case, Widakuswara v. Lake. [../../../../case/46275/]\n\nThe following day, the court extended the TRO until May 29 to allow additional time for briefing and argument.\n\nOn May 21, the court noted that the D.C. Circuit's pending en banc review in Widakuswara involved issues directly relevant to this case. To avoid issuing a premature ruling on the PI, the court ordered the parties to indicate by May 23, 2025, whether they consented to extending the TRO pending resolution of the injunction motion. The parties submitted their respective responses, with defendants objecting to the extension and plaintiffs consenting to it. The TRO expired on May 29, 2025.\n\nOn June 2, plaintiffs filed a motion for a narrow TRO prohibiting defendants from further pausing, canceling, or otherwise terminating IMLS grants or contracts, or from withholding disbursement of funds in accordance with such grants or contracts. In the alternative, plaintiffs requested that the court rule on their motion for a PI within seven days.\n\nOn June 6, the court denied plaintiffs' motion for a PI, citing recent indications from the Supreme Court and Circuit Judges that actions seeking reinstatement of federal grants fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims rather than the district courts. It further ordered the parties to file a joint status report proposing next steps by June 13, 2025, and denied plaintiffs' June 2 motion as moot.\n\nThe parties filed a joint status report on June 13, outlining defendants' intention to file a motion to dismiss and plaintiffs' proposal to proceed with expedited summary judgment briefing.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",
