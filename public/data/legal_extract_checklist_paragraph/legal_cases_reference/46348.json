    "target": "Executive Order 14251, issued by President Trump on March 27, 2025, revoked collective bargaining rights for the majority of federal workers, citing \u201cnational security\u201d as justification. Section 3 of the Executive Order specifically excluded employees of certain \u201cagency subdivisions\u201d within the Department of State and USAID from the protections of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS). On the same day, the Acting Director of the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum guiding departments and agencies on implementing the Executive Order, including identifying which agencies and subdivisions were to be excluded. This lawsuit challenges Executive Order 14251.\n\nOn April 7, 2025, the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), a federal labor union that represents approximately 18,000 foreign service members, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Trump, the Office of Personnel Management, the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The plaintiffs claimed that the Executive Order exceeded the President's authority, violated the Separation of Powers, and infringed on First Amendment rights. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to bar defendants from enforcing the Executive Order or any accompanying guidance. Judge Paul L. Friedman presides over the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the Executive Order was ultra vires because it effectively repealed the FSLMRS without a valid national security justification, a power reserved for Congress, thereby violating the Separation of Powers. Additionally, the plaintiffs alleged the Executive Order constituted politically motivated retaliation, issued in response to the union's opposition to administration policies. Citing a White House \u201cfact sheet\u201d that described federal unions as \u201chostile\u201d and at \u201cwar\u201d with the President\u2019s agenda, the plaintiffs claimed the Executive Order violated their First Amendment rights and sought to punish the union for defending the nonpartisan integrity of American diplomacy.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the Executive order caused irreparable harm, including the deprivation of statutory rights to organize and bargain collectively, the loss of 86% of the union\u2019s revenue from dues, the forced return of union officers to regular duties, the potential closure of AFSA\u2019s offices and loss of records, and member confusion over whether union representation remained available. The plaintiffs maintained that an injunction served the public interest, noting that Congress recognized collective bargaining as essential to the effective conduct of public business. The plaintiffs emphasized that preserving the status quo would not harm the defendants, whereas the union and its members would suffer significant injury without relief.\n\nOn May 14, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, blocking implementation of Section 3 of the Executive Order. The court held that the Order was ultra vires and that the union and its members would suffer irreparable harm without an injunction.\n\nOn May 21, 2025, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the defendants sought an immediate administrative stay and a stay pending appeal of the preliminary injunction. That same day, they also filed a motion for a stay pending appeal in the district court.\n\nThe defendants contended that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the Foreign Service Act (FSA) provides the exclusive procedures for labor-management claims, which must be heard by the Foreign Service Labor Relations Board. They maintained that the Executive Order was lawful, as the President has discretion under the FSA to exclude agencies for national security reasons, and that the court erred by failing to defer to this determination. The defendants further argued that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate irreparable harm, noting their ability to collect dues and potential for reimbursement, while the injunction itself harmed the President by restricting his national security prerogatives. Finally, they asserted that the equitable factors overwhelmingly favored a stay, claiming that the district court had usurped a national-security authority statutorily entrusted to the President.\n\nWith Judge Friedman unavailable, the motion was referred to Judge Randolph D. Moss. On May 30, 2025, Judge Moss deferred ruling, noting that defendants\u2019 week-long delay in seeking a stay undermined their claims of irreparable harm. He explained that Judge Friedman\u2019s absence and the D.C. Circuit\u2019s expedited consideration made deferral appropriate, though Friedman could revisit the matter upon his return.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, Judge Friedman denied the motion for a stay, finding that the defendants had not shown a likelihood of success on appeal. 2025 WL 1695059. The court held that any harm to the defendants was minimal, as the injunction preserved the status quo by maintaining collective bargaining rights established by Congress. While noting that a related D.C. Circuit case, National Treasury Employees Union [../../../../case/46319/], No. 25-5157, recognized potential irreparable harm in a national security context, the court distinguished that case, concluding the defendants had not demonstrated comparable harm here. In contrast, the plaintiffs would suffer \u201cimmense and irreparable injury\u201d without an injunction, including disrupted communications with union representatives, loss of official time for union officers, and termination of union dues deductions, all of which impeded the union\u2019s core mission. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 reliance on National Treasury Employees Union, noting that a cited \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d document was inapplicable.\n\nHowever, on June 20, 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted a stay pending appeal. 2025 WL 1742853. The court reasoned that \u201cforeign affairs are critical to national security,\u201d and that the defendants were likely correct in asserting that the Executive Order was consistent with the Foreign Service Act\u2019s delegation of national-security determinations to the President. The court emphasized that review of such decisions should be highly deferential, since they implicated the President\u2019s core Article II responsibilities. On July 14, the plaintiffs filed a motion for rehearing en banc, which the court denied on July 30.\n\nBack in the district court, on August 4, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment.\n\nThe case remains ongoing.",

    "target": "Executive Order 14251, issued by President Trump on March 27, 2025, revoked collective bargaining rights for the majority of federal workers, citing \u201cnational security\u201d as justification. Section 3 of the Executive Order specifically excluded employees of certain \u201cagency subdivisions\u201d within the Department of State and USAID from the protections of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS). On the same day, the Acting Director of the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum guiding departments and agencies on implementing the Executive Order, including identifying which agencies and subdivisions were to be excluded. This lawsuit challenges Executive Order 14251.\n\nOn April 7, 2025, the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), a federal labor union that represents approximately 18,000 foreign service members, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Trump, the Office of Personnel Management, the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The plaintiffs claimed that the Executive Order exceeded the President's authority, violated the Separation of Powers, and infringed on First Amendment rights. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to bar defendants from enforcing the Executive Order or any accompanying guidance. Judge Paul L. Friedman presides over the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the Executive Order was ultra vires because it effectively repealed the FSLMRS without a valid national security justification, a power reserved for Congress, thereby violating the Separation of Powers. Additionally, the plaintiffs alleged the Executive Order constituted politically motivated retaliation, issued in response to the union's opposition to administration policies. Citing a White House \u201cfact sheet\u201d that described federal unions as \u201chostile\u201d and at \u201cwar\u201d with the President\u2019s agenda, the plaintiffs claimed the Executive Order violated their First Amendment rights and sought to punish the union for defending the nonpartisan integrity of American diplomacy.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the Executive order caused irreparable harm, including the deprivation of statutory rights to organize and bargain collectively, the loss of 86% of the union\u2019s revenue from dues, the forced return of union officers to regular duties, the potential closure of AFSA\u2019s offices and loss of records, and member confusion over whether union representation remained available. The plaintiffs maintained that an injunction served the public interest, noting that Congress recognized collective bargaining as essential to the effective conduct of public business. The plaintiffs emphasized that preserving the status quo would not harm the defendants, whereas the union and its members would suffer significant injury without relief.\n\nOn May 14, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, blocking implementation of Section 3 of the Executive Order. The court held that the Order was ultra vires and that the union and its members would suffer irreparable harm without an injunction.\n\nOn May 21, 2025, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the defendants sought an immediate administrative stay and a stay pending appeal of the preliminary injunction. That same day, they also filed a motion for a stay pending appeal in the district court.\n\nThe defendants contended that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the Foreign Service Act (FSA) provides the exclusive procedures for labor-management claims, which must be heard by the Foreign Service Labor Relations Board. They maintained that the Executive Order was lawful, as the President has discretion under the FSA to exclude agencies for national security reasons, and that the court erred by failing to defer to this determination. The defendants further argued that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate irreparable harm, noting their ability to collect dues and potential for reimbursement, while the injunction itself harmed the President by restricting his national security prerogatives. Finally, they asserted that the equitable factors overwhelmingly favored a stay, claiming that the district court had usurped a national-security authority statutorily entrusted to the President.\n\nWith Judge Friedman unavailable, the motion was referred to Judge Randolph D. Moss. On May 30, 2025, Judge Moss deferred ruling, noting that defendants\u2019 week-long delay in seeking a stay undermined their claims of irreparable harm. He explained that Judge Friedman\u2019s absence and the D.C. Circuit\u2019s expedited consideration made deferral appropriate, though Friedman could revisit the matter upon his return.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, Judge Friedman denied the motion for a stay, finding that the defendants had not shown a likelihood of success on appeal. 2025 WL 1695059. The court held that any harm to the defendants was minimal, as the injunction preserved the status quo by maintaining collective bargaining rights established by Congress. While noting that a related D.C. Circuit case, National Treasury Employees Union [../../../../case/46319/], No. 25-5157, recognized potential irreparable harm in a national security context, the court distinguished that case, concluding the defendants had not demonstrated comparable harm here. In contrast, the plaintiffs would suffer \u201cimmense and irreparable injury\u201d without an injunction, including disrupted communications with union representatives, loss of official time for union officers, and termination of union dues deductions, all of which impeded the union\u2019s core mission. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 reliance on National Treasury Employees Union, noting that a cited \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d document was inapplicable.\n\nHowever, on June 20, 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted a stay pending appeal. 2025 WL 1742853. The court reasoned that \u201cforeign affairs are critical to national security,\u201d and that the defendants were likely correct in asserting that the Executive Order was consistent with the Foreign Service Act\u2019s delegation of national-security determinations to the President. The court emphasized that review of such decisions should be highly deferential, since they implicated the President\u2019s core Article II responsibilities. On July 14, the plaintiffs filed a motion for rehearing en banc, which the court denied on July 30.\n\nBack in the district court, on August 4, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment.\n\nThe case remains ongoing.",

    "target": "Executive Order 14251, issued by President Trump on March 27, 2025, revoked collective bargaining rights for the majority of federal workers, citing \u201cnational security\u201d as justification. Section 3 of the Executive Order specifically excluded employees of certain \u201cagency subdivisions\u201d within the Department of State and USAID from the protections of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS). On the same day, the Acting Director of the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum guiding departments and agencies on implementing the Executive Order, including identifying which agencies and subdivisions were to be excluded. This lawsuit challenges Executive Order 14251.\n\nOn April 7, 2025, the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), a federal labor union that represents approximately 18,000 foreign service members, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Trump, the Office of Personnel Management, the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The plaintiffs claimed that the Executive Order exceeded the President's authority, violated the Separation of Powers, and infringed on First Amendment rights. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to bar defendants from enforcing the Executive Order or any accompanying guidance. Judge Paul L. Friedman presides over the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the Executive Order was ultra vires because it effectively repealed the FSLMRS without a valid national security justification, a power reserved for Congress, thereby violating the Separation of Powers. Additionally, the plaintiffs alleged the Executive Order constituted politically motivated retaliation, issued in response to the union's opposition to administration policies. Citing a White House \u201cfact sheet\u201d that described federal unions as \u201chostile\u201d and at \u201cwar\u201d with the President\u2019s agenda, the plaintiffs claimed the Executive Order violated their First Amendment rights and sought to punish the union for defending the nonpartisan integrity of American diplomacy.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the Executive order caused irreparable harm, including the deprivation of statutory rights to organize and bargain collectively, the loss of 86% of the union\u2019s revenue from dues, the forced return of union officers to regular duties, the potential closure of AFSA\u2019s offices and loss of records, and member confusion over whether union representation remained available. The plaintiffs maintained that an injunction served the public interest, noting that Congress recognized collective bargaining as essential to the effective conduct of public business. The plaintiffs emphasized that preserving the status quo would not harm the defendants, whereas the union and its members would suffer significant injury without relief.\n\nOn May 14, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, blocking implementation of Section 3 of the Executive Order. The court held that the Order was ultra vires and that the union and its members would suffer irreparable harm without an injunction.\n\nOn May 21, 2025, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the defendants sought an immediate administrative stay and a stay pending appeal of the preliminary injunction. That same day, they also filed a motion for a stay pending appeal in the district court.\n\nThe defendants contended that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the Foreign Service Act (FSA) provides the exclusive procedures for labor-management claims, which must be heard by the Foreign Service Labor Relations Board. They maintained that the Executive Order was lawful, as the President has discretion under the FSA to exclude agencies for national security reasons, and that the court erred by failing to defer to this determination. The defendants further argued that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate irreparable harm, noting their ability to collect dues and potential for reimbursement, while the injunction itself harmed the President by restricting his national security prerogatives. Finally, they asserted that the equitable factors overwhelmingly favored a stay, claiming that the district court had usurped a national-security authority statutorily entrusted to the President.\n\nWith Judge Friedman unavailable, the motion was referred to Judge Randolph D. Moss. On May 30, 2025, Judge Moss deferred ruling, noting that defendants\u2019 week-long delay in seeking a stay undermined their claims of irreparable harm. He explained that Judge Friedman\u2019s absence and the D.C. Circuit\u2019s expedited consideration made deferral appropriate, though Friedman could revisit the matter upon his return.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, Judge Friedman denied the motion for a stay, finding that the defendants had not shown a likelihood of success on appeal. 2025 WL 1695059. The court held that any harm to the defendants was minimal, as the injunction preserved the status quo by maintaining collective bargaining rights established by Congress. While noting that a related D.C. Circuit case, National Treasury Employees Union [../../../../case/46319/], No. 25-5157, recognized potential irreparable harm in a national security context, the court distinguished that case, concluding the defendants had not demonstrated comparable harm here. In contrast, the plaintiffs would suffer \u201cimmense and irreparable injury\u201d without an injunction, including disrupted communications with union representatives, loss of official time for union officers, and termination of union dues deductions, all of which impeded the union\u2019s core mission. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 reliance on National Treasury Employees Union, noting that a cited \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d document was inapplicable.\n\nHowever, on June 20, 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted a stay pending appeal. 2025 WL 1742853. The court reasoned that \u201cforeign affairs are critical to national security,\u201d and that the defendants were likely correct in asserting that the Executive Order was consistent with the Foreign Service Act\u2019s delegation of national-security determinations to the President. The court emphasized that review of such decisions should be highly deferential, since they implicated the President\u2019s core Article II responsibilities. On July 14, the plaintiffs filed a motion for rehearing en banc, which the court denied on July 30.\n\nBack in the district court, on August 4, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment.\n\nThe case remains ongoing.",

They maintained that the Executive Order was lawful, as the President has discretion under the FSA to exclude agencies for national security reasons, and that the court erred by failing to defer to this determination. The defendants further argued that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate irreparable harm, noting their ability to collect dues and potential for reimbursement, while the injunction itself harmed the President by restricting his national security prerogatives. Finally, they asserted that the equitable factors overwhelmingly favored a stay, claiming that the district court had usurped a national-security authority statutorily entrusted to the President.\n\nWith Judge Friedman unavailable, the motion was referred to Judge Randolph D. Moss. On May 30, 2025, Judge Moss deferred ruling, noting that defendants\u2019 week-long delay in seeking a stay undermined their claims of irreparable harm. He explained that Judge Friedman\u2019s absence and the D.C. Circuit\u2019s expedited consideration made deferral appropriate, though Friedman could revisit the matter upon his return.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, Judge Friedman denied the motion for a stay, finding that the defendants had not shown a likelihood of success on appeal. 2025 WL 1695059. The court held that any harm to the defendants was minimal, as the injunction preserved the status quo by maintaining collective bargaining rights established by Congress. While noting that a related D.C. Circuit case, National Treasury Employees Union [../../../../case/46319/], No. 25-5157, recognized potential irreparable harm in a national security context, the court distinguished that case, concluding the defendants had not demonstrated comparable harm here. In contrast, the plaintiffs would suffer \u201cimmense and irreparable injury\u201d without an injunction, including disrupted communications with union representatives, loss of official time for union officers, and termination of union dues deductions, all of which impeded the union\u2019s core mission. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 reliance on National Treasury Employees Union, noting that a cited \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d document was inapplicable.\n\nHowever, on June 20, 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted a stay pending appeal. 2025 WL 1742853. The court reasoned that \u201cforeign affairs are critical to national security,\u201d and that the defendants were likely correct in asserting that the Executive Order was consistent with the Foreign Service Act\u2019s delegation of national-security determinations to the President. The court emphasized that review of such decisions should be highly deferential, since they implicated the President\u2019s core Article II responsibilities. On July 14, the plaintiffs filed a motion for rehearing en banc, which the court denied on July 30.\n\nBack in the district court, on August 4, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment.\n\nThe case remains ongoing.",

    "target": "Executive Order 14251, issued by President Trump on March 27, 2025, revoked collective bargaining rights for the majority of federal workers, citing \u201cnational security\u201d as justification. Section 3 of the Executive Order specifically excluded employees of certain \u201cagency subdivisions\u201d within the Department of State and USAID from the protections of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS). On the same day, the Acting Director of the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum guiding departments and agencies on implementing the Executive Order, including identifying which agencies and subdivisions were to be excluded. This lawsuit challenges Executive Order 14251.\n\nOn April 7, 2025, the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), a federal labor union that represents approximately 18,000 foreign service members, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Trump, the Office of Personnel Management, the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The plaintiffs claimed that the Executive Order exceeded the President's authority, violated the Separation of Powers, and infringed on First Amendment rights. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to bar defendants from enforcing the Executive Order or any accompanying guidance. Judge Paul L. Friedman presides over the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the Executive Order was ultra vires because it effectively repealed the FSLMRS without a valid national security justification, a power reserved for Congress, thereby violating the Separation of Powers. Additionally, the plaintiffs alleged the Executive Order constituted politically motivated retaliation, issued in response to the union's opposition to administration policies. Citing a White House \u201cfact sheet\u201d that described federal unions as \u201chostile\u201d and at \u201cwar\u201d with the President\u2019s agenda, the plaintiffs claimed the Executive Order violated their First Amendment rights and sought to punish the union for defending the nonpartisan integrity of American diplomacy.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the Executive order caused irreparable harm, including the deprivation of statutory rights to organize and bargain collectively, the loss of 86% of the union\u2019s revenue from dues, the forced return of union officers to regular duties, the potential closure of AFSA\u2019s offices and loss of records, and member confusion over whether union representation remained available. The plaintiffs maintained that an injunction served the public interest, noting that Congress recognized collective bargaining as essential to the effective conduct of public business. The plaintiffs emphasized that preserving the status quo would not harm the defendants, whereas the union and its members would suffer significant injury without relief.\n\nOn May 14, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, blocking implementation of Section 3 of the Executive Order. The court held that the Order was ultra vires and that the union and its members would suffer irreparable harm without an injunction.\n\nOn May 21, 2025, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the defendants sought an immediate administrative stay and a stay pending appeal of the preliminary injunction.

    "target": "Executive Order 14251, issued by President Trump on March 27, 2025, revoked collective bargaining rights for the majority of federal workers, citing \u201cnational security\u201d as justification. Section 3 of the Executive Order specifically excluded employees of certain \u201cagency subdivisions\u201d within the Department of State and USAID from the protections of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS). On the same day, the Acting Director of the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum guiding departments and agencies on implementing the Executive Order, including identifying which agencies and subdivisions were to be excluded. This lawsuit challenges Executive Order 14251.\n\nOn April 7, 2025, the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), a federal labor union that represents approximately 18,000 foreign service members, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Trump, the Office of Personnel Management, the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The plaintiffs claimed that the Executive Order exceeded the President's authority, violated the Separation of Powers, and infringed on First Amendment rights. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to bar defendants from enforcing the Executive Order or any accompanying guidance. Judge Paul L. Friedman presides over the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the Executive Order was ultra vires because it effectively repealed the FSLMRS without a valid national security justification, a power reserved for Congress, thereby violating the Separation of Powers. Additionally, the plaintiffs alleged the Executive Order constituted politically motivated retaliation, issued in response to the union's opposition to administration policies. Citing a White House \u201cfact sheet\u201d that described federal unions as \u201chostile\u201d and at \u201cwar\u201d with the President\u2019s agenda, the plaintiffs claimed the Executive Order violated their First Amendment rights and sought to punish the union for defending the nonpartisan integrity of American diplomacy.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the Executive order caused irreparable harm, including the deprivation of statutory rights to organize and bargain collectively, the loss of 86% of the union\u2019s revenue from dues, the forced return of union officers to regular duties, the potential closure of AFSA\u2019s offices and loss of records, and member confusion over whether union representation remained available. The plaintiffs maintained that an injunction served the public interest, noting that Congress recognized collective bargaining as essential to the effective conduct of public business. The plaintiffs emphasized that preserving the status quo would not harm the defendants, whereas the union and its members would suffer significant injury without relief.\n\nOn May 14, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, blocking implementation of Section 3 of the Executive Order. The court held that the Order was ultra vires and that the union and its members would suffer irreparable harm without an injunction.\n\nOn May 21, 2025, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the defendants sought an immediate administrative stay and a stay pending appeal of the preliminary injunction. That same day, they also filed a motion for a stay pending appeal in the district court.\n\nThe defendants contended that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the Foreign Service Act (FSA) provides the exclusive procedures for labor-management claims, which must be heard by the Foreign Service Labor Relations Board. They maintained that the Executive Order was lawful, as the President has discretion under the FSA to exclude agencies for national security reasons, and that the court erred by failing to defer to this determination. The defendants further argued that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate irreparable harm, noting their ability to collect dues and potential for reimbursement, while the injunction itself harmed the President by restricting his national security prerogatives. Finally, they asserted that the equitable factors overwhelmingly favored a stay, claiming that the district court had usurped a national-security authority statutorily entrusted to the President.\n\nWith Judge Friedman unavailable, the motion was referred to Judge Randolph D. Moss. On May 30, 2025, Judge Moss deferred ruling, noting that defendants\u2019 week-long delay in seeking a stay undermined their claims of irreparable harm. He explained that Judge Friedman\u2019s absence and the D.C. Circuit\u2019s expedited consideration made deferral appropriate, though Friedman could revisit the matter upon his return.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, Judge Friedman denied the motion for a stay, finding that the defendants had not shown a likelihood of success on appeal. 2025 WL 1695059. The court held that any harm to the defendants was minimal, as the injunction preserved the status quo by maintaining collective bargaining rights established by Congress. While noting that a related D.C. Circuit case, National Treasury Employees Union [../../../../case/46319/], No. 25-5157, recognized potential irreparable harm in a national security context, the court distinguished that case, concluding the defendants had not demonstrated comparable harm here. In contrast, the plaintiffs would suffer \u201cimmense and irreparable injury\u201d without an injunction, including disrupted communications with union representatives, loss of official time for union officers, and termination of union dues deductions, all of which impeded the union\u2019s core mission. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 reliance on National Treasury Employees Union, noting that a cited \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d document was inapplicable.\n\nHowever, on June 20, 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted a stay pending appeal. 2025 WL 1742853. The court reasoned that \u201cforeign affairs are critical to national security,\u201d and that the defendants were likely correct in asserting that the Executive Order was consistent with the Foreign Service Act\u2019s delegation of national-security determinations to the President. The court emphasized that review of such decisions should be highly deferential, since they implicated the President\u2019s core Article II responsibilities. On July 14, the plaintiffs filed a motion for rehearing en banc, which the court denied on July 30.\n\nBack in the district court, on August 4, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment.\n\nThe case remains ongoing.",

    "target": "Executive Order 14251, issued by President Trump on March 27, 2025, revoked collective bargaining rights for the majority of federal workers, citing \u201cnational security\u201d as justification. Section 3 of the Executive Order specifically excluded employees of certain \u201cagency subdivisions\u201d within the Department of State and USAID from the protections of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS). On the same day, the Acting Director of the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum guiding departments and agencies on implementing the Executive Order, including identifying which agencies and subdivisions were to be excluded. This lawsuit challenges Executive Order 14251.\n\nOn April 7, 2025, the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), a federal labor union that represents approximately 18,000 foreign service members, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Trump, the Office of Personnel Management, the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The plaintiffs claimed that the Executive Order exceeded the President's authority, violated the Separation of Powers, and infringed on First Amendment rights. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to bar defendants from enforcing the Executive Order or any accompanying guidance. Judge Paul L. Friedman presides over the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the Executive Order was ultra vires because it effectively repealed the FSLMRS without a valid national security justification, a power reserved for Congress, thereby violating the Separation of Powers. Additionally, the plaintiffs alleged the Executive Order constituted politically motivated retaliation, issued in response to the union's opposition to administration policies. Citing a White House \u201cfact sheet\u201d that described federal unions as \u201chostile\u201d and at \u201cwar\u201d with the President\u2019s agenda, the plaintiffs claimed the Executive Order violated their First Amendment rights and sought to punish the union for defending the nonpartisan integrity of American diplomacy.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the Executive order caused irreparable harm, including the deprivation of statutory rights to organize and bargain collectively, the loss of 86% of the union\u2019s revenue from dues, the forced return of union officers to regular duties, the potential closure of AFSA\u2019s offices and loss of records, and member confusion over whether union representation remained available. The plaintiffs maintained that an injunction served the public interest, noting that Congress recognized collective bargaining as essential to the effective conduct of public business. The plaintiffs emphasized that preserving the status quo would not harm the defendants, whereas the union and its members would suffer significant injury without relief.\n\nOn May 14, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, blocking implementation of Section 3 of the Executive Order. The court held that the Order was ultra vires and that the union and its members would suffer irreparable harm without an injunction.\n\nOn May 21, 2025, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the defendants sought an immediate administrative stay and a stay pending appeal of the preliminary injunction. That same day, they also filed a motion for a stay pending appeal in the district court.\n\nThe defendants contended that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the Foreign Service Act (FSA) provides the exclusive procedures for labor-management claims, which must be heard by the Foreign Service Labor Relations Board. They maintained that the Executive Order was lawful, as the President has discretion under the FSA to exclude agencies for national security reasons, and that the court erred by failing to defer to this determination. The defendants further argued that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate irreparable harm, noting their ability to collect dues and potential for reimbursement, while the injunction itself harmed the President by restricting his national security prerogatives. Finally, they asserted that the equitable factors overwhelmingly favored a stay, claiming that the district court had usurped a national-security authority statutorily entrusted to the President.\n\nWith Judge Friedman unavailable, the motion was referred to Judge Randolph D. Moss. On May 30, 2025, Judge Moss deferred ruling, noting that defendants\u2019 week-long delay in seeking a stay undermined their claims of irreparable harm. He explained that Judge Friedman\u2019s absence and the D.C. Circuit\u2019s expedited consideration made deferral appropriate, though Friedman could revisit the matter upon his return.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, Judge Friedman denied the motion for a stay, finding that the defendants had not shown a likelihood of success on appeal. 2025 WL 1695059. The court held that any harm to the defendants was minimal, as the injunction preserved the status quo by maintaining collective bargaining rights established by Congress. While noting that a related D.C. Circuit case, National Treasury Employees Union [../../../../case/46319/], No. 25-5157, recognized potential irreparable harm in a national security context, the court distinguished that case, concluding the defendants had not demonstrated comparable harm here. In contrast, the plaintiffs would suffer \u201cimmense and irreparable injury\u201d without an injunction, including disrupted communications with union representatives, loss of official time for union officers, and termination of union dues deductions, all of which impeded the union\u2019s core mission. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 reliance on National Treasury Employees Union, noting that a cited \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d document was inapplicable.\n\nHowever, on June 20, 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted a stay pending appeal. 2025 WL 1742853. The court reasoned that \u201cforeign affairs are critical to national security,\u201d and that the defendants were likely correct in asserting that the Executive Order was consistent with the Foreign Service Act\u2019s delegation of national-security determinations to the President. The court emphasized that review of such decisions should be highly deferential, since they implicated the President\u2019s core Article II responsibilities. On July 14, the plaintiffs filed a motion for rehearing en banc, which the court denied on July 30.\n\nBack in the district court, on August 4, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment.\n\nThe case remains ongoing.",
