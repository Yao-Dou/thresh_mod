    "target": "This case challenges two actions by the Trump Administration\u2019s National Science Foundation (NSF) that sixteen states argue will severely undermine the United States\u2019 leadership in STEM. First, in a policy issued on April 18, 2025, the NSF \u201cannounced that it would no longer abide by Congress\u2019s longstanding policy to promote a robust STEM workforce that draws in underrepresented populations.\u201d The Priority Directive stated that the NSF's efforts would not give preference to certain groups over others and that research projects with a narrow impact limited to subgroups based on protected characteristics did not align with its priorities. As a result, the NSF began issuing termination notices en masse to projects, including many in the plaintiff states, that sought to increase STEM participation by women, minorities, and people with disabilities.\n\nAdditionally, on May 2, 2025, the NSF issued its Indirect Cost Directive, which, in a break from prior policy, stated that it would not cover indirect costs at a rate higher than \"15% of modified total direct costs (MTDC), as defined in 2 CFR 200.1\" for grants and cooperative agreements awarded to Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs). Indirect costs fund vital research infrastructure, including facility costs like lab space, utilities, and custodial services, as well as administrative costs such as managing security requirements and preventing conflicts of interest.\n\nOn May 28, 2025, the states, represented by their respective attorneys general, filed this lawsuit against the National Science Foundation and its director in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers and Take Care Clause, and alleged that the NSF had exceeded its statutory authority. The case was assigned to Judge John P. Cronan.\n\nAlongside the complaint, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the NSF\u2019s Priority Directive was unlawful and caused irreparable harm. They contended that the directive was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d under the Administrative Procedure Act because it lacked a reasoned explanation for the change in priorities. They also argued that it was \u201ccontrary to law and beyond statutory authority\u201d because it ignored Congress\u2019s clear mandate to promote and fund projects aimed at increasing participation in STEM fields by women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities. The plaintiffs sought to enjoin the directive\u2019s implementation and reinstate the terminated grants, asserting that without such relief, they and their institutions would face serious non-monetary harm from the disruption of critical research and the undermining of congressional policy. They further sought to have the court vacate the directive under the APA, declare it unlawful, and issue both preliminary and permanent injunctions.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, the National Association of Scholars (NAS) moved to intervene in the case as a defendant, contending that \"NAS has an interest in ensuring that National Science Foundation research grants are awarded based on scientific merit rather than racial or gender preferences contrary to the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of Equal Protection.\" NAS further argued that its interests were not adequately represented by the current defendants, since \"there is no guarantee that the revised Policy Directive will remain unchanged. This administration or a new administration could resurrect policies for allocating National Science Foundation research funding based on DEI principles,\" potentially causing a divergence of positions among the defendants. On June 30, the court denied NAS\u2019s motion to intervene, concluding that NAS had not demonstrated that its interests were inadequately protected by the existing parties in the litigation.\n\nThe court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction on August 1, 2025, finding that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. 2025 WL 2180478. The court's primary reasoning was that it likely lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case, as the plaintiffs' request to restore funding for the terminated grants was essentially a claim for monetary relief from the federal government exceeding $10,000. Such claims, under the Tucker Act, fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims, not the District Court. The court cited a recent Supreme Court case, Department of Education v. California, to support its conclusion that the plaintiffs' claims were likely contractual in nature and subject to the Tucker Act. It concluded that the plaintiffs' claims \"have traversed both sides of the jurisdictional boundary\" between the two courts, which weighed against granting the preliminary relief they sought.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenges two actions by the Trump Administration\u2019s National Science Foundation (NSF) that sixteen states argue will severely undermine the United States\u2019 leadership in STEM. First, in a policy issued on April 18, 2025, the NSF \u201cannounced that it would no longer abide by Congress\u2019s longstanding policy to promote a robust STEM workforce that draws in underrepresented populations.\u201d The Priority Directive stated that the NSF's efforts would not give preference to certain groups over others and that research projects with a narrow impact limited to subgroups based on protected characteristics did not align with its priorities. As a result, the NSF began issuing termination notices en masse to projects, including many in the plaintiff states, that sought to increase STEM participation by women, minorities, and people with disabilities.\n\nAdditionally, on May 2, 2025, the NSF issued its Indirect Cost Directive, which, in a break from prior policy, stated that it would not cover indirect costs at a rate higher than \"15% of modified total direct costs (MTDC), as defined in 2 CFR 200.1\" for grants and cooperative agreements awarded to Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs). Indirect costs fund vital research infrastructure, including facility costs like lab space, utilities, and custodial services, as well as administrative costs such as managing security requirements and preventing conflicts of interest.\n\nOn May 28, 2025, the states, represented by their respective attorneys general, filed this lawsuit against the National Science Foundation and its director in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers and Take Care Clause, and alleged that the NSF had exceeded its statutory authority. The case was assigned to Judge John P. Cronan.\n\nAlongside the complaint, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the NSF\u2019s Priority Directive was unlawful and caused irreparable harm. They contended that the directive was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d under the Administrative Procedure Act because it lacked a reasoned explanation for the change in priorities. They also argued that it was \u201ccontrary to law and beyond statutory authority\u201d because it ignored Congress\u2019s clear mandate to promote and fund projects aimed at increasing participation in STEM fields by women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities. The plaintiffs sought to enjoin the directive\u2019s implementation and reinstate the terminated grants, asserting that without such relief, they and their institutions would face serious non-monetary harm from the disruption of critical research and the undermining of congressional policy. They further sought to have the court vacate the directive under the APA, declare it unlawful, and issue both preliminary and permanent injunctions.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, the National Association of Scholars (NAS) moved to intervene in the case as a defendant, contending that \"NAS has an interest in ensuring that National Science Foundation research grants are awarded based on scientific merit rather than racial or gender preferences contrary to the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of Equal Protection.\" NAS further argued that its interests were not adequately represented by the current defendants, since \"there is no guarantee that the revised Policy Directive will remain unchanged. This administration or a new administration could resurrect policies for allocating National Science Foundation research funding based on DEI principles,\" potentially causing a divergence of positions among the defendants. On June 30, the court denied NAS\u2019s motion to intervene, concluding that NAS had not demonstrated that its interests were inadequately protected by the existing parties in the litigation.\n\nThe court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction on August 1, 2025, finding that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. 2025 WL 2180478. The court's primary reasoning was that it likely lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case, as the plaintiffs' request to restore funding for the terminated grants was essentially a claim for monetary relief from the federal government exceeding $10,000. Such claims, under the Tucker Act, fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims, not the District Court. The court cited a recent Supreme Court case, Department of Education v. California, to support its conclusion that the plaintiffs' claims were likely contractual in nature and subject to the Tucker Act. It concluded that the plaintiffs' claims \"have traversed both sides of the jurisdictional boundary\" between the two courts, which weighed against granting the preliminary relief they sought.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

They further sought to have the court vacate the directive under the APA, declare it unlawful, and issue both preliminary and permanent injunctions.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, the National Association of Scholars (NAS) moved to intervene in the case as a defendant, contending that \"NAS has an interest in ensuring that National Science Foundation research grants are awarded based on scientific merit rather than racial or gender preferences contrary to the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of Equal Protection.\" NAS further argued that its interests were not adequately represented by the current defendants, since \"there is no guarantee that the revised Policy Directive will remain unchanged. This administration or a new administration could resurrect policies for allocating National Science Foundation research funding based on DEI principles,\" potentially causing a divergence of positions among the defendants. On June 30, the court denied NAS\u2019s motion to intervene, concluding that NAS had not demonstrated that its interests were inadequately protected by the existing parties in the litigation.\n\nThe court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction on August 1, 2025, finding that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. 2025 WL 2180478. The court's primary reasoning was that it likely lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case, as the plaintiffs' request to restore funding for the terminated grants was essentially a claim for monetary relief from the federal government exceeding $10,000. Such claims, under the Tucker Act, fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims, not the District Court. The court cited a recent Supreme Court case, Department of Education v. California, to support its conclusion that the plaintiffs' claims were likely contractual in nature and subject to the Tucker Act. It concluded that the plaintiffs' claims \"have traversed both sides of the jurisdictional boundary\" between the two courts, which weighed against granting the preliminary relief they sought.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenges two actions by the Trump Administration\u2019s National Science Foundation (NSF) that sixteen states argue will severely undermine the United States\u2019 leadership in STEM. First, in a policy issued on April 18, 2025, the NSF \u201cannounced that it would no longer abide by Congress\u2019s longstanding policy to promote a robust STEM workforce that draws in underrepresented populations.\u201d The Priority Directive stated that the NSF's efforts would not give preference to certain groups over others and that research projects with a narrow impact limited to subgroups based on protected characteristics did not align with its priorities. As a result, the NSF began issuing termination notices en masse to projects, including many in the plaintiff states, that sought to increase STEM participation by women, minorities, and people with disabilities.\n\nAdditionally, on May 2, 2025, the NSF issued its Indirect Cost Directive, which, in a break from prior policy, stated that it would not cover indirect costs at a rate higher than \"15% of modified total direct costs (MTDC), as defined in 2 CFR 200.1\" for grants and cooperative agreements awarded to Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs). Indirect costs fund vital research infrastructure, including facility costs like lab space, utilities, and custodial services, as well as administrative costs such as managing security requirements and preventing conflicts of interest.\n\nOn May 28, 2025, the states, represented by their respective attorneys general, filed this lawsuit against the National Science Foundation and its director in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers and Take Care Clause, and alleged that the NSF had exceeded its statutory authority. The case was assigned to Judge John P. Cronan.\n\nAlongside the complaint, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the NSF\u2019s Priority Directive was unlawful and caused irreparable harm. They contended that the directive was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d under the Administrative Procedure Act because it lacked a reasoned explanation for the change in priorities.
