    "target": "This case challenged an Iowa state law that criminalized entering Iowa after being deported or denied entry into the United States.\n\nOn April 10, 2024, the Governor of Iowa signed into law SF 2340, to become effective on July 1, 2024. SF 2340, or \"the law,\" created a new state crime and imposed state penalties on noncitizens in Iowa who had unlawfully reentered the United States. \u00a0It also required Iowa state courts to order the removal of certain noncitizens from the United States.\n\nOn May 9, 2024, the plaintiff, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), filed suit against the state of Iowa in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, seeking an injunction against the enforcement of the law. The DOJ argued that SF 2340 was preempted by federal law and violated the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and the Foreign Commerce Clause. The DOJ also argued that SF 2340 constituted an unlawful attempt by Iowa to create its own immigration system; however, only the federal government has a right to regulate immigration. The DOJ sued the State of Iowa, the Governor of Iowa, the Attorney General of Iowa, the Iowa Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Commissioner of DPS (collectively, \"the state\"). It sought a declaratory judgment, a preliminary injunction to stop the defendants from enforcing SF 2340, and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Stephen Locher.\n\nOn May 13, 2024, the DOJ filed motions for a preliminary injunction and a permanent injunction, arguing that enforcing SF 2340 would cause harm to the United States and interfere with foreign relations and the federal immigration scheme. On June 17, 2024, the court granted the requested preliminary injunction. It reasoned that the United States had a viable cause of action and was likely to prevail on its preemption claim.\n\nThe court issued a single decision preliminarily enjoining the law in this case and in\u00a0Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice v. Bird, 4:24-cv-00161, though the cases were not formally consolidated.\n\nOn June 19, 2024, the defendants filed an appeal of the preliminary injunction in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (USCA Case Number 24-2265). The parties filed a joint motion for a stay pending appeal on August 28, 2024, which the district court granted on August 29, 2024. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's preliminary injunction on January 24, 2025. The case was then transferred back to the district court for further proceedings.\n\nHowever, after the start of the second Trump administration, the DOJ reversed its stance on the Iowa law and filed a notice of voluntary dismissal on March 14, 2025. On April 16, 2025, the Eighth Circuit dismissed Iowa\u2019s appeal, vacated the district court\u2019s order granting the United States\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, and remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss this action.\n\nThis case is closed.",

    "target": "This case challenged an Iowa state law that criminalized entering Iowa after being deported or denied entry into the United States.\n\nOn April 10, 2024, the Governor of Iowa signed into law SF 2340, to become effective on July 1, 2024. SF 2340, or \"the law,\" created a new state crime and imposed state penalties on noncitizens in Iowa who had unlawfully reentered the United States. \u00a0It also required Iowa state courts to order the removal of certain noncitizens from the United States.\n\nOn May 9, 2024, the plaintiff, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), filed suit against the state of Iowa in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, seeking an injunction against the enforcement of the law. The DOJ argued that SF 2340 was preempted by federal law and violated the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and the Foreign Commerce Clause. The DOJ also argued that SF 2340 constituted an unlawful attempt by Iowa to create its own immigration system; however, only the federal government has a right to regulate immigration. The DOJ sued the State of Iowa, the Governor of Iowa, the Attorney General of Iowa, the Iowa Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Commissioner of DPS (collectively, \"the state\"). It sought a declaratory judgment, a preliminary injunction to stop the defendants from enforcing SF 2340, and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Stephen Locher.\n\nOn May 13, 2024, the DOJ filed motions for a preliminary injunction and a permanent injunction, arguing that enforcing SF 2340 would cause harm to the United States and interfere with foreign relations and the federal immigration scheme. On June 17, 2024, the court granted the requested preliminary injunction. It reasoned that the United States had a viable cause of action and was likely to prevail on its preemption claim.\n\nThe court issued a single decision preliminarily enjoining the law in this case and in\u00a0Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice v. Bird, 4:24-cv-00161, though the cases were not formally consolidated.\n\nOn June 19, 2024, the defendants filed an appeal of the preliminary injunction in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (USCA Case Number 24-2265). The parties filed a joint motion for a stay pending appeal on August 28, 2024, which the district court granted on August 29, 2024. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's preliminary injunction on January 24, 2025. The case was then transferred back to the district court for further proceedings.\n\nHowever, after the start of the second Trump administration, the DOJ reversed its stance on the Iowa law and filed a notice of voluntary dismissal on March 14, 2025. On April 16, 2025, the Eighth Circuit dismissed Iowa\u2019s appeal, vacated the district court\u2019s order granting the United States\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, and remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss this action.\n\nThis case is closed.",

    "target": "This case challenged an Iowa state law that criminalized entering Iowa after being deported or denied entry into the United States.\n\nOn April 10, 2024, the Governor of Iowa signed into law SF 2340, to become effective on July 1, 2024. SF 2340, or \"the law,\" created a new state crime and imposed state penalties on noncitizens in Iowa who had unlawfully reentered the United States. \u00a0It also required Iowa state courts to order the removal of certain noncitizens from the United States.\n\nOn May 9, 2024, the plaintiff, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), filed suit against the state of Iowa in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, seeking an injunction against the enforcement of the law. The DOJ argued that SF 2340 was preempted by federal law and violated the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and the Foreign Commerce Clause. The DOJ also argued that SF 2340 constituted an unlawful attempt by Iowa to create its own immigration system; however, only the federal government has a right to regulate immigration. The DOJ sued the State of Iowa, the Governor of Iowa, the Attorney General of Iowa, the Iowa Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Commissioner of DPS (collectively, \"the state\"). It sought a declaratory judgment, a preliminary injunction to stop the defendants from enforcing SF 2340, and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Stephen Locher.\n\nOn May 13, 2024, the DOJ filed motions for a preliminary injunction and a permanent injunction, arguing that enforcing SF 2340 would cause harm to the United States and interfere with foreign relations and the federal immigration scheme. On June 17, 2024, the court granted the requested preliminary injunction. It reasoned that the United States had a viable cause of action and was likely to prevail on its preemption claim.\n\nThe court issued a single decision preliminarily enjoining the law in this case and in\u00a0Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice v. Bird, 4:24-cv-00161, though the cases were not formally consolidated.\n\nOn June 19, 2024, the defendants filed an appeal of the preliminary injunction in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (USCA Case Number 24-2265). The parties filed a joint motion for a stay pending appeal on August 28, 2024, which the district court granted on August 29, 2024. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's preliminary injunction on January 24, 2025. The case was then transferred back to the district court for further proceedings.\n\nHowever, after the start of the second Trump administration, the DOJ reversed its stance on the Iowa law and filed a notice of voluntary dismissal on March 14, 2025. On April 16, 2025, the Eighth Circuit dismissed Iowa\u2019s appeal, vacated the district court\u2019s order granting the United States\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, and remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss this action.\n\nThis case is closed.",
