    "target": "This case challenged the Trump administration\u2019s disclosure of confidential Medicaid beneficiary data to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for immigration enforcement. On July 1, 2025, twenty-one states and the District of Columbia filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Secretary Kristi Noem. The plaintiffs, represented by their respective state attorneys general, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Privacy Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), and constitutional claims under the Spending Clause and separation-of-powers principles.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Vince Chhabria.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that in early June 2025, HHS\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) secretly transferred Medicaid beneficiary data\u2014including names, addresses, Medicaid IDs, immigration status, and potentially protected health information\u2014to DHS. Following internal agency objections, HHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) formalized this arrangement on July 9, 2025, through an Interagency Exchange Agreement (IEA), granting ICE direct access to CMS\u2019s Integrated Data Repository and the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS), containing over 78 million Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019 personal records. Plaintiffs claimed this unprecedented transfer violated federal statutes strictly limiting disclosure of Medicaid data to purposes directly connected to Medicaid administration, and undermined decades of federal assurances regarding patient privacy.\n\nPlaintiffs also alleged procedural and constitutional violations. They asserted that HHS\u2019s decision constituted a final agency action requiring notice-and-comment rulemaking under the APA, that it was arbitrary and capricious for failing to consider reliance interests and severe public health consequences, and that the new data-sharing policy retroactively imposed ambiguous, coercive conditions on federal Medicaid funding contrary to the Spending Clause.\n\nOn July 11, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking to prohibit HHS from further transferring Medicaid data to DHS, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), or other federal agencies, and to bar DHS from using the data for immigration enforcement or population surveillance. In support, plaintiffs submitted declarations from senior Medicaid officials in California, Washington, Maryland, Delaware, and representatives of healthcare providers. These declarations detailed irreparable harms already suffered, including widespread fear and disenrollment from Medicaid programs among immigrant communities; reduced use of necessary emergency and preventive healthcare services; and substantial financial burdens on healthcare providers and states due to uncompensated care and lost federal funding.\n\nOn July 14, the parties stipulated to expedite briefing on the preliminary injunction, and the court scheduled oral argument for August 7, 2025. On August 12, 2025, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 2356224. At the outset, it noted that there did not appear to be anything categorically unlawful about DHS obtaining data from agencies like HHS for immigration enforcement purposes, and that several federal statutes appeared to permit, and sometimes even require, such disclosures. Nonetheless, in light of existing, longstanding ICE policy against using Medicaid data for immigration enforcement, and reliance on that policy by states, providers, and patients, \"it was incumbent upon the agencies to carry out a reasoned decisionmaking process before changing them.\"\u00a0 The record in this case suggested that no such process occurred, and that the defendants did not consider important policy tradeoffs before making the challenged changes. Thus, the court concluded that, on the record before it, the states had demonstrated a likelihood of success on their \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d claim under the APA, which would require HHS and DHS to go back and engage in a reasoned decisionmaking process.\u00a0 Moreover, the states were likely to suffer irreparable harm from the way the agencies implemented the change, and the balance of hardships and public interest further warranted preliminary relief. The court therefore preliminarily enjoined DHS from using Medicaid data obtained from the plaintiff states for immigration enforcement purposes, including data already acquired from CMS, and preliminarily enjoined HHS from sharing Medicaid data obtained from the plaintiff states with DHS for immigration enforcement purposes. The preliminary injunction was to remain in place until the shorter of: (1) the termination of this litigation; or (2) 14 days after both DHS and HHS have completed a reasoned decisionmaking process or rulemaking, if necessary. The court declined, however, to require the agencies to undertake notice and comment rulemaking, holding that the states had not demonstrated that such rulemaking was required. It noted that this was without prejudice to re-raising the issue later. It further noted its skepticism on the merits of the plaintiffs' Spending Clause claim, but denied it as moot in light of the ruling under the APA which would enable the agencies to consider the Spending Clause issue as part of the reasoned decisionmaking process.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged the Trump administration\u2019s disclosure of confidential Medicaid beneficiary data to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for immigration enforcement. On July 1, 2025, twenty-one states and the District of Columbia filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Secretary Kristi Noem. The plaintiffs, represented by their respective state attorneys general, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Privacy Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), and constitutional claims under the Spending Clause and separation-of-powers principles.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Vince Chhabria.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that in early June 2025, HHS\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) secretly transferred Medicaid beneficiary data\u2014including names, addresses, Medicaid IDs, immigration status, and potentially protected health information\u2014to DHS. Following internal agency objections, HHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) formalized this arrangement on July 9, 2025, through an Interagency Exchange Agreement (IEA), granting ICE direct access to CMS\u2019s Integrated Data Repository and the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS), containing over 78 million Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019 personal records. Plaintiffs claimed this unprecedented transfer violated federal statutes strictly limiting disclosure of Medicaid data to purposes directly connected to Medicaid administration, and undermined decades of federal assurances regarding patient privacy.\n\nPlaintiffs also alleged procedural and constitutional violations. They asserted that HHS\u2019s decision constituted a final agency action requiring notice-and-comment rulemaking under the APA, that it was arbitrary and capricious for failing to consider reliance interests and severe public health consequences, and that the new data-sharing policy retroactively imposed ambiguous, coercive conditions on federal Medicaid funding contrary to the Spending Clause.\n\nOn July 11, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking to prohibit HHS from further transferring Medicaid data to DHS, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), or other federal agencies, and to bar DHS from using the data for immigration enforcement or population surveillance. In support, plaintiffs submitted declarations from senior Medicaid officials in California, Washington, Maryland, Delaware, and representatives of healthcare providers. These declarations detailed irreparable harms already suffered, including widespread fear and disenrollment from Medicaid programs among immigrant communities; reduced use of necessary emergency and preventive healthcare services; and substantial financial burdens on healthcare providers and states due to uncompensated care and lost federal funding.\n\nOn July 14, the parties stipulated to expedite briefing on the preliminary injunction, and the court scheduled oral argument for August 7, 2025. On August 12, 2025, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 2356224. At the outset, it noted that there did not appear to be anything categorically unlawful about DHS obtaining data from agencies like HHS for immigration enforcement purposes, and that several federal statutes appeared to permit, and sometimes even require, such disclosures. Nonetheless, in light of existing, longstanding ICE policy against using Medicaid data for immigration enforcement, and reliance on that policy by states, providers, and patients, \"it was incumbent upon the agencies to carry out a reasoned decisionmaking process before changing them.\"\u00a0 The record in this case suggested that no such process occurred, and that the defendants did not consider important policy tradeoffs before making the challenged changes. Thus, the court concluded that, on the record before it, the states had demonstrated a likelihood of success on their \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d claim under the APA, which would require HHS and DHS to go back and engage in a reasoned decisionmaking process.\u00a0 Moreover, the states were likely to suffer irreparable harm from the way the agencies implemented the change, and the balance of hardships and public interest further warranted preliminary relief. The court therefore preliminarily enjoined DHS from using Medicaid data obtained from the plaintiff states for immigration enforcement purposes, including data already acquired from CMS, and preliminarily enjoined HHS from sharing Medicaid data obtained from the plaintiff states with DHS for immigration enforcement purposes. The preliminary injunction was to remain in place until the shorter of: (1) the termination of this litigation; or (2) 14 days after both DHS and HHS have completed a reasoned decisionmaking process or rulemaking, if necessary. The court declined, however, to require the agencies to undertake notice and comment rulemaking, holding that the states had not demonstrated that such rulemaking was required. It noted that this was without prejudice to re-raising the issue later. It further noted its skepticism on the merits of the plaintiffs' Spending Clause claim, but denied it as moot in light of the ruling under the APA which would enable the agencies to consider the Spending Clause issue as part of the reasoned decisionmaking process.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged the Trump administration\u2019s disclosure of confidential Medicaid beneficiary data to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for immigration enforcement. On July 1, 2025, twenty-one states and the District of Columbia filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Secretary Kristi Noem. The plaintiffs, represented by their respective state attorneys general, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Privacy Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), and constitutional claims under the Spending Clause and separation-of-powers principles.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Vince Chhabria.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that in early June 2025, HHS\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) secretly transferred Medicaid beneficiary data\u2014including names, addresses, Medicaid IDs, immigration status, and potentially protected health information\u2014to DHS. Following internal agency objections, HHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) formalized this arrangement on July 9, 2025, through an Interagency Exchange Agreement (IEA), granting ICE direct access to CMS\u2019s Integrated Data Repository and the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS), containing over 78 million Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019 personal records. Plaintiffs claimed this unprecedented transfer violated federal statutes strictly limiting disclosure of Medicaid data to purposes directly connected to Medicaid administration, and undermined decades of federal assurances regarding patient privacy.\n\nPlaintiffs also alleged procedural and constitutional violations. They asserted that HHS\u2019s decision constituted a final agency action requiring notice-and-comment rulemaking under the APA, that it was arbitrary and capricious for failing to consider reliance interests and severe public health consequences, and that the new data-sharing policy retroactively imposed ambiguous, coercive conditions on federal Medicaid funding contrary to the Spending Clause.\n\nOn July 11, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking to prohibit HHS from further transferring Medicaid data to DHS, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), or other federal agencies, and to bar DHS from using the data for immigration enforcement or population surveillance. In support, plaintiffs submitted declarations from senior Medicaid officials in California, Washington, Maryland, Delaware, and representatives of healthcare providers. These declarations detailed irreparable harms already suffered, including widespread fear and disenrollment from Medicaid programs among immigrant communities; reduced use of necessary emergency and preventive healthcare services; and substantial financial burdens on healthcare providers and states due to uncompensated care and lost federal funding.\n\nOn July 14, the parties stipulated to expedite briefing on the preliminary injunction, and the court scheduled oral argument for August 7, 2025. On August 12, 2025, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 2356224. At the outset, it noted that there did not appear to be anything categorically unlawful about DHS obtaining data from agencies like HHS for immigration enforcement purposes, and that several federal statutes appeared to permit, and sometimes even require, such disclosures. Nonetheless, in light of existing, longstanding ICE policy against using Medicaid data for immigration enforcement, and reliance on that policy by states, providers, and patients, \"it was incumbent upon the agencies to carry out a reasoned decisionmaking process before changing them.\"\u00a0 The record in this case suggested that no such process occurred, and that the defendants did not consider important policy tradeoffs before making the challenged changes. Thus, the court concluded that, on the record before it, the states had demonstrated a likelihood of success on their \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d claim under the APA, which would require HHS and DHS to go back and engage in a reasoned decisionmaking process.\u00a0 Moreover, the states were likely to suffer irreparable harm from the way the agencies implemented the change, and the balance of hardships and public interest further warranted preliminary relief. The court therefore preliminarily enjoined DHS from using Medicaid data obtained from the plaintiff states for immigration enforcement purposes, including data already acquired from CMS, and preliminarily enjoined HHS from sharing Medicaid data obtained from the plaintiff states with DHS for immigration enforcement purposes. The preliminary injunction was to remain in place until the shorter of: (1) the termination of this litigation; or (2) 14 days after both DHS and HHS have completed a reasoned decisionmaking process or rulemaking, if necessary. The court declined, however, to require the agencies to undertake notice and comment rulemaking, holding that the states had not demonstrated that such rulemaking was required. It noted that this was without prejudice to re-raising the issue later. It further noted its skepticism on the merits of the plaintiffs' Spending Clause claim, but denied it as moot in light of the ruling under the APA which would enable the agencies to consider the Spending Clause issue as part of the reasoned decisionmaking process.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged the Trump administration\u2019s disclosure of confidential Medicaid beneficiary data to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for immigration enforcement. On July 1, 2025, twenty-one states and the District of Columbia filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Secretary Kristi Noem. The plaintiffs, represented by their respective state attorneys general, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Privacy Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), and constitutional claims under the Spending Clause and separation-of-powers principles.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Vince Chhabria.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that in early June 2025, HHS\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) secretly transferred Medicaid beneficiary data\u2014including names, addresses, Medicaid IDs, immigration status, and potentially protected health information\u2014to DHS. Following internal agency objections, HHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) formalized this arrangement on July 9, 2025, through an Interagency Exchange Agreement (IEA), granting ICE direct access to CMS\u2019s Integrated Data Repository and the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS), containing over 78 million Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019 personal records. Plaintiffs claimed this unprecedented transfer violated federal statutes strictly limiting disclosure of Medicaid data to purposes directly connected to Medicaid administration, and undermined decades of federal assurances regarding patient privacy.\n\nPlaintiffs also alleged procedural and constitutional violations. They asserted that HHS\u2019s decision constituted a final agency action requiring notice-and-comment rulemaking under the APA, that it was arbitrary and capricious for failing to consider reliance interests and severe public health consequences, and that the new data-sharing policy retroactively imposed ambiguous, coercive conditions on federal Medicaid funding contrary to the Spending Clause.\n\nOn July 11, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking to prohibit HHS from further transferring Medicaid data to DHS, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), or other federal agencies, and to bar DHS from using the data for immigration enforcement or population surveillance. In support, plaintiffs submitted declarations from senior Medicaid officials in California, Washington, Maryland, Delaware, and representatives of healthcare providers. These declarations detailed irreparable harms already suffered, including widespread fear and disenrollment from Medicaid programs among immigrant communities; reduced use of necessary emergency and preventive healthcare services; and substantial financial burdens on healthcare providers and states due to uncompensated care and lost federal funding.\n\nOn July 14, the parties stipulated to expedite briefing on the preliminary injunction, and the court scheduled oral argument for August 7, 2025. On August 12, 2025, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 2356224. At the outset, it noted that there did not appear to be anything categorically unlawful about DHS obtaining data from agencies like HHS for immigration enforcement purposes, and that several federal statutes appeared to permit, and sometimes even require, such disclosures. Nonetheless, in light of existing, longstanding ICE policy against using Medicaid data for immigration enforcement, and reliance on that policy by states, providers, and patients, \"it was incumbent upon the agencies to carry out a reasoned decisionmaking process before changing them.\"\u00a0 The record in this case suggested that no such process occurred, and that the defendants did not consider important policy tradeoffs before making the challenged changes. Thus, the court concluded that, on the record before it, the states had demonstrated a likelihood of success on their \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d claim under the APA, which would require HHS and DHS to go back and engage in a reasoned decisionmaking process.\u00a0 Moreover, the states were likely to suffer irreparable harm from the way the agencies implemented the change, and the balance of hardships and public interest further warranted preliminary relief. The court therefore preliminarily enjoined DHS from using Medicaid data obtained from the plaintiff states for immigration enforcement purposes, including data already acquired from CMS, and preliminarily enjoined HHS from sharing Medicaid data obtained from the plaintiff states with DHS for immigration enforcement purposes. The preliminary injunction was to remain in place until the shorter of: (1) the termination of this litigation; or (2) 14 days after both DHS and HHS have completed a reasoned decisionmaking process or rulemaking, if necessary. The court declined, however, to require the agencies to undertake notice and comment rulemaking, holding that the states had not demonstrated that such rulemaking was required. It noted that this was without prejudice to re-raising the issue later. It further noted its skepticism on the merits of the plaintiffs' Spending Clause claim, but denied it as moot in light of the ruling under the APA which would enable the agencies to consider the Spending Clause issue as part of the reasoned decisionmaking process.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",
