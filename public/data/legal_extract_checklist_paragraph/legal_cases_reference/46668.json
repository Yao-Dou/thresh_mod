    "target": "This is a class action lawsuit challenging the detention of immigrants at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. On January 29, 2025, President Trump issued a presidential memorandum titled \u201cExpanding the Migrant Operations Center at Naval Station Guant\u00e1namo Bay to Full Capacity,\u201d directing the U.S. Departments of Defense and Homeland Security to prepare the facility to detain up to 30,000 migrants. The memorandum eliminated procedural safeguards such as bond hearings, individualized custody reviews, and access to immigration courts. It also authorized the transfer of noncitizens\u2014many initially apprehended and detained in the United States\u2014to both the Migrant Operations Center and the military-run Camp 6. These directives marked a significant departure from the statutory requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which mandates notice, custody hearings, and removal procedures before prolonged detention. Guant\u00e1namo Bay Naval Base was originally established as a military detention facility for enemy combatants captured during the U.S. \u201cWar on Terror.\u201d Its use for immigration detention represents a significant shift from its historical purpose, raising concerns about subjecting immigrants to conditions designed for wartime detainees.\n\nOn June 4, 2025, two individual plaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit and petition for writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its Secretary, the U.S. Department of Defense and its Secretary, and the U.S. State Department and its Secretary. The case was initially assigned to U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols but reassigned to Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan on June 18, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that their detention at Guant\u00e1namo Bay exceeded the defendants\u2019 statutory authority and violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Fifth Amendment. They challenged their prolonged detention without notice or bond hearings, citing harsh and unlawful conditions and a lack of procedural protections. They further alleged that they were apprehended and detained solely because of their foreign status, without individualized assessments or due process, effectively criminalizing their origin in violation of constitutional protections. The complaint detailed punitive conditions at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, including solitary confinement, limited recreation, inadequate hygiene, denial of legal and religious materials, physical abuse, and family separation. It also referenced government press releases and statements by President Trump describing Guant\u00e1namo as a \u201cdetention center for illegal immigrants\u201d and expressing the administration\u2019s intent to \u201censure strict enforcement\u201d of immigration laws by expanding Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s use as a detention site.\n\nRepresented by private counsel from the ACLU, ACLU-DC, Center for Constitutional Rights, and the International Refugee Assistance Project, the plaintiffs sought a writ of habeas corpus for immediate release, declaratory relief recognizing violations of their constitutional and statutory rights, and injunctive relief to prevent detention of them or others in the proposed class without proper notice, individualized custody determinations, and bond hearings. They also sought an order requiring compliance with immigration statutes and regulations, as well as attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n\nAlso on June 4, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, seeking to represent all similarly situated immigration detainees at Guant\u00e1namo. The proposed class was defined as \u201cAll immigration detainees originally apprehended and detained in the United States, and who are, or will be, held at Naval Station Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.\u201d\n\nOn August 4, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case. The defendants claimed the case was moot because the named plaintiffs were no longer in U.S. custody and were unlikely to be detained again under the challenged policies. They also argued the court lacked jurisdiction because the Immigration and Nationality Act barred judicial review of the defendants\u2019 decision to transfer an alien to a detention facility. Finally, they contended that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims failed to state a cause of action, arguing that the Administrative Procedure Act claims challenged a presidential order and non-final actions, the Secretary of Homeland Security had statutory authority to detain individuals overseas, and the presidential memorandum was not arbitrary or capricious. They further argued that the plaintiffs had not plausibly alleged a Fifth Amendment due process violation and that adequate safeguards ensured acceptable detention conditions.\n\nThe case remains ongoing.",

    "target": "This is a class action lawsuit challenging the detention of immigrants at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. On January 29, 2025, President Trump issued a presidential memorandum titled \u201cExpanding the Migrant Operations Center at Naval Station Guant\u00e1namo Bay to Full Capacity,\u201d directing the U.S. Departments of Defense and Homeland Security to prepare the facility to detain up to 30,000 migrants. The memorandum eliminated procedural safeguards such as bond hearings, individualized custody reviews, and access to immigration courts. It also authorized the transfer of noncitizens\u2014many initially apprehended and detained in the United States\u2014to both the Migrant Operations Center and the military-run Camp 6. These directives marked a significant departure from the statutory requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which mandates notice, custody hearings, and removal procedures before prolonged detention. Guant\u00e1namo Bay Naval Base was originally established as a military detention facility for enemy combatants captured during the U.S. \u201cWar on Terror.\u201d Its use for immigration detention represents a significant shift from its historical purpose, raising concerns about subjecting immigrants to conditions designed for wartime detainees.\n\nOn June 4, 2025, two individual plaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit and petition for writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its Secretary, the U.S. Department of Defense and its Secretary, and the U.S. State Department and its Secretary. The case was initially assigned to U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols but reassigned to Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan on June 18, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that their detention at Guant\u00e1namo Bay exceeded the defendants\u2019 statutory authority and violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Fifth Amendment. They challenged their prolonged detention without notice or bond hearings, citing harsh and unlawful conditions and a lack of procedural protections. They further alleged that they were apprehended and detained solely because of their foreign status, without individualized assessments or due process, effectively criminalizing their origin in violation of constitutional protections. The complaint detailed punitive conditions at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, including solitary confinement, limited recreation, inadequate hygiene, denial of legal and religious materials, physical abuse, and family separation. It also referenced government press releases and statements by President Trump describing Guant\u00e1namo as a \u201cdetention center for illegal immigrants\u201d and expressing the administration\u2019s intent to \u201censure strict enforcement\u201d of immigration laws by expanding Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s use as a detention site.\n\nRepresented by private counsel from the ACLU, ACLU-DC, Center for Constitutional Rights, and the International Refugee Assistance Project, the plaintiffs sought a writ of habeas corpus for immediate release, declaratory relief recognizing violations of their constitutional and statutory rights, and injunctive relief to prevent detention of them or others in the proposed class without proper notice, individualized custody determinations, and bond hearings. They also sought an order requiring compliance with immigration statutes and regulations, as well as attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n\nAlso on June 4, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, seeking to represent all similarly situated immigration detainees at Guant\u00e1namo. The proposed class was defined as \u201cAll immigration detainees originally apprehended and detained in the United States, and who are, or will be, held at Naval Station Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.\u201d\n\nOn August 4, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case. The defendants claimed the case was moot because the named plaintiffs were no longer in U.S. custody and were unlikely to be detained again under the challenged policies. They also argued the court lacked jurisdiction because the Immigration and Nationality Act barred judicial review of the defendants\u2019 decision to transfer an alien to a detention facility. Finally, they contended that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims failed to state a cause of action, arguing that the Administrative Procedure Act claims challenged a presidential order and non-final actions, the Secretary of Homeland Security had statutory authority to detain individuals overseas, and the presidential memorandum was not arbitrary or capricious. They further argued that the plaintiffs had not plausibly alleged a Fifth Amendment due process violation and that adequate safeguards ensured acceptable detention conditions.\n\nThe case remains ongoing.",

    "target": "This is a class action lawsuit challenging the detention of immigrants at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. On January 29, 2025, President Trump issued a presidential memorandum titled \u201cExpanding the Migrant Operations Center at Naval Station Guant\u00e1namo Bay to Full Capacity,\u201d directing the U.S. Departments of Defense and Homeland Security to prepare the facility to detain up to 30,000 migrants. The memorandum eliminated procedural safeguards such as bond hearings, individualized custody reviews, and access to immigration courts. It also authorized the transfer of noncitizens\u2014many initially apprehended and detained in the United States\u2014to both the Migrant Operations Center and the military-run Camp 6. These directives marked a significant departure from the statutory requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which mandates notice, custody hearings, and removal procedures before prolonged detention. Guant\u00e1namo Bay Naval Base was originally established as a military detention facility for enemy combatants captured during the U.S. \u201cWar on Terror.\u201d Its use for immigration detention represents a significant shift from its historical purpose, raising concerns about subjecting immigrants to conditions designed for wartime detainees.\n\nOn June 4, 2025, two individual plaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit and petition for writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its Secretary, the U.S. Department of Defense and its Secretary, and the U.S. State Department and its Secretary. The case was initially assigned to U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols but reassigned to Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan on June 18, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that their detention at Guant\u00e1namo Bay exceeded the defendants\u2019 statutory authority and violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Fifth Amendment. They challenged their prolonged detention without notice or bond hearings, citing harsh and unlawful conditions and a lack of procedural protections. They further alleged that they were apprehended and detained solely because of their foreign status, without individualized assessments or due process, effectively criminalizing their origin in violation of constitutional protections. The complaint detailed punitive conditions at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, including solitary confinement, limited recreation, inadequate hygiene, denial of legal and religious materials, physical abuse, and family separation. It also referenced government press releases and statements by President Trump describing Guant\u00e1namo as a \u201cdetention center for illegal immigrants\u201d and expressing the administration\u2019s intent to \u201censure strict enforcement\u201d of immigration laws by expanding Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s use as a detention site.\n\nRepresented by private counsel from the ACLU, ACLU-DC, Center for Constitutional Rights, and the International Refugee Assistance Project, the plaintiffs sought a writ of habeas corpus for immediate release, declaratory relief recognizing violations of their constitutional and statutory rights, and injunctive relief to prevent detention of them or others in the proposed class without proper notice, individualized custody determinations, and bond hearings. They also sought an order requiring compliance with immigration statutes and regulations, as well as attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n\nAlso on June 4, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, seeking to represent all similarly situated immigration detainees at Guant\u00e1namo. The proposed class was defined as \u201cAll immigration detainees originally apprehended and detained in the United States, and who are, or will be, held at Naval Station Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.\u201d\n\nOn August 4, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case. The defendants claimed the case was moot because the named plaintiffs were no longer in U.S. custody and were unlikely to be detained again under the challenged policies. They also argued the court lacked jurisdiction because the Immigration and Nationality Act barred judicial review of the defendants\u2019 decision to transfer an alien to a detention facility. Finally, they contended that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims failed to state a cause of action, arguing that the Administrative Procedure Act claims challenged a presidential order and non-final actions, the Secretary of Homeland Security had statutory authority to detain individuals overseas, and the presidential memorandum was not arbitrary or capricious. They further argued that the plaintiffs had not plausibly alleged a Fifth Amendment due process violation and that adequate safeguards ensured acceptable detention conditions.\n\nThe case remains ongoing.",

It also referenced government press releases and statements by President Trump describing Guant\u00e1namo as a \u201cdetention center for illegal immigrants\u201d and expressing the administration\u2019s intent to \u201censure strict enforcement\u201d of immigration laws by expanding Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s use as a detention site.\n\nRepresented by private counsel from the ACLU, ACLU-DC, Center for Constitutional Rights, and the International Refugee Assistance Project, the plaintiffs sought a writ of habeas corpus for immediate release, declaratory relief recognizing violations of their constitutional and statutory rights, and injunctive relief to prevent detention of them or others in the proposed class without proper notice, individualized custody determinations, and bond hearings. They also sought an order requiring compliance with immigration statutes and regulations, as well as attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n\nAlso on June 4, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, seeking to represent all similarly situated immigration detainees at Guant\u00e1namo. The proposed class was defined as \u201cAll immigration detainees originally apprehended and detained in the United States, and who are, or will be, held at Naval Station Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.\u201d\n\nOn August 4, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case. The defendants claimed the case was moot because the named plaintiffs were no longer in U.S. custody and were unlikely to be detained again under the challenged policies. They also argued the court lacked jurisdiction because the Immigration and Nationality Act barred judicial review of the defendants\u2019 decision to transfer an alien to a detention facility. Finally, they contended that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims failed to state a cause of action, arguing that the Administrative Procedure Act claims challenged a presidential order and non-final actions, the Secretary of Homeland Security had statutory authority to detain individuals overseas, and the presidential memorandum was not arbitrary or capricious. They further argued that the plaintiffs had not plausibly alleged a Fifth Amendment due process violation and that adequate safeguards ensured acceptable detention conditions.\n\nThe case remains ongoing.",
