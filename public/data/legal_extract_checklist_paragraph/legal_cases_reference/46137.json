    "target": "The U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New indicted New York City Mayor Eric Adams for alleged corruption in September 2024, but after President Trump took office, his Department of Justice directed that charges be dropped.\u00a0 Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove said the prosecution \u201cunduly restricted\u201d the mayor\u2019s ability to \u201cdevote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime that has escalated under the policies of the prior Administration.\u201d\n\nSeveral DOJ leaders resigned rather than accept this instruction; the interim US attorney for the Southern District, Danielle Sassoon (a Republican), resigned, stating that the proposed dismissal was an illegitimate exchange for Adams' help with Trump\u2019s immigration policy. According to press reports [https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-russia-ukraine-02-18-25#cm7allb71000h3b6neqhr3n87], seven other DOJ officials also resigned, some immediately and others within the next several days.\n\nBove's responsive letter to Sassoon accused her of \u201cdisobeying direct orders implementing the policy of a duly elected President\u201d and \u201cpursuing a politically motivated prosecution despite an express instruction to dismiss the case. You lost sight of the oath that you took when you started at the Department of Justice.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 14, 2025, Bove and two other prosecutors signed the request to the court to drop charges (without prejudice to their being refiled in the future).\u00a0 This request is under consideration by the court; the case is before Judge Dale Ho. Some former prosecutors and the organization Common Cause have sought to be heard on the appropriate next steps, opposing dismissal. A hearing is scheduled for Feb. 19, 2025; Judge Ho has asked the parties to \"be prepared to address, inter alia, the reasons for the Government\u2019s motion, the scope and effect of Mayor Adams\u2019s \u201cconsent[] in writing,\u201d and the procedure for resolution of the motion.\"\n\nOn Feb. 21, 2025, the court cancelled the scheduled trial, and--because the government and the defendant were in agreement about dismissing charges--appointed Paul Clement as amicus curiae to present additional arguments on the Government's Motion to Dismiss. Clement had served as U.S. Solicitor General in the George W. Bush Administration.\u00a0 His brief, filed March 7, took the position that the case should be dismissed--but with prejudice (that is, closing off the possibility of it being refiled) to avoid giving the federal government ongoing leverage over Mayor Adams' activities.\u00a0 He wrote: \"\u201cA dismissal without prejudice creates a palpable sense that the prosecution outlined in the indictment and approved by a grand jury could be renewed, a prospect that hangs like the proverbial sword of Damocles over the accused.\"\n\nIn the meanwhile, the defendant filed a motion asking the court for exactly the outcome Clement subsequently recommended--to dismiss his indictment with prejudice.\n\nOn April 2, 2025, the court issued its final opinion and order dismissing the case. The court dismissed the case with prejudice, finding that \"dismissing the case without prejudice would create the perception that the Mayor's freedom depends on his ability to carry out the immigration enforcement priorities of the administration, and that he might be more beholden to the demands of the federal government than to the wishes of his own constituents.\" Further, the court found that any \"appearances of impropriety\" in the case were pretextual and unmerited, waving away any concerns that any party had improper motives in dismissing the case. This result thus prevents any future suit alleging the same facts from being brought against the Mayor.\n\nThis case is now closed.",

    "target": "The U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New indicted New York City Mayor Eric Adams for alleged corruption in September 2024, but after President Trump took office, his Department of Justice directed that charges be dropped.\u00a0 Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove said the prosecution \u201cunduly restricted\u201d the mayor\u2019s ability to \u201cdevote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime that has escalated under the policies of the prior Administration.\u201d\n\nSeveral DOJ leaders resigned rather than accept this instruction; the interim US attorney for the Southern District, Danielle Sassoon (a Republican), resigned, stating that the proposed dismissal was an illegitimate exchange for Adams' help with Trump\u2019s immigration policy. According to press reports [https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-russia-ukraine-02-18-25#cm7allb71000h3b6neqhr3n87], seven other DOJ officials also resigned, some immediately and others within the next several days.\n\nBove's responsive letter to Sassoon accused her of \u201cdisobeying direct orders implementing the policy of a duly elected President\u201d and \u201cpursuing a politically motivated prosecution despite an express instruction to dismiss the case. You lost sight of the oath that you took when you started at the Department of Justice.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 14, 2025, Bove and two other prosecutors signed the request to the court to drop charges (without prejudice to their being refiled in the future).\u00a0 This request is under consideration by the court; the case is before Judge Dale Ho. Some former prosecutors and the organization Common Cause have sought to be heard on the appropriate next steps, opposing dismissal. A hearing is scheduled for Feb. 19, 2025; Judge Ho has asked the parties to \"be prepared to address, inter alia, the reasons for the Government\u2019s motion, the scope and effect of Mayor Adams\u2019s \u201cconsent[] in writing,\u201d and the procedure for resolution of the motion.\"\n\nOn Feb. 21, 2025, the court cancelled the scheduled trial, and--because the government and the defendant were in agreement about dismissing charges--appointed Paul Clement as amicus curiae to present additional arguments on the Government's Motion to Dismiss. Clement had served as U.S. Solicitor General in the George W. Bush Administration.\u00a0 His brief, filed March 7, took the position that the case should be dismissed--but with prejudice (that is, closing off the possibility of it being refiled) to avoid giving the federal government ongoing leverage over Mayor Adams' activities.\u00a0 He wrote: \"\u201cA dismissal without prejudice creates a palpable sense that the prosecution outlined in the indictment and approved by a grand jury could be renewed, a prospect that hangs like the proverbial sword of Damocles over the accused.\"\n\nIn the meanwhile, the defendant filed a motion asking the court for exactly the outcome Clement subsequently recommended--to dismiss his indictment with prejudice.\n\nOn April 2, 2025, the court issued its final opinion and order dismissing the case. The court dismissed the case with prejudice, finding that \"dismissing the case without prejudice would create the perception that the Mayor's freedom depends on his ability to carry out the immigration enforcement priorities of the administration, and that he might be more beholden to the demands of the federal government than to the wishes of his own constituents.\" Further, the court found that any \"appearances of impropriety\" in the case were pretextual and unmerited, waving away any concerns that any party had improper motives in dismissing the case. This result thus prevents any future suit alleging the same facts from being brought against the Mayor.\n\nThis case is now closed.",
