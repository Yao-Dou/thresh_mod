    "target": "This case is about alleged antisemitism at Harvard College. On May 22, 2024, the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights (\u201cBrandeis Center\u201d), the Jewish Americans for Fairness in Education (\u201cJAFE\u201d) and Harvard graduate students brought this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Harvard. The plaintiffs alleged that Harvard failed to adequately protect its Jewish and Israeli students from discrimination; they brought claims under Title VI for direct discrimination, a hostile educational environment, and retaliation. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was assigned to Judge Richard E. Sterns.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that antisemitism had become widespread at Harvard in recent years, particularly following October 7, 2023, and that Harvard had not done enough to address it. Specifically, the complaint alleged that Harvard students and professors had frequently engaged in antisemitic speech, creating a hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli students, and that one student had been harassed and assaulted due to his Jewish and/or Israeli heritage. The complaint also alleged that an investigation commissioned by Harvard had concluded that a professor discriminated against several Jewish Israeli students because they submitted a project about the state of Israel. According to the complaint, the Brandeis Center and affected students had previously raised grievances with Harvard administrators, but Harvard had failed to respond effectively to these complaints.\n\nOn January 21, 2025, the parties reached a mutual agreement for dismissal and issued a joint press release outlining the terms of their private settlement. As part of the agreement, Harvard committed to implementing several measures aimed at reducing antisemitism on campus. Harvard agreed to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism and apply it when evaluating allegations of antisemitic discrimination. Furthermore, Harvard pledged to publish a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document clarifying that Jewish and Israeli identities are protected under Harvard's Non-Discrimination and Anti-Bullying Policies. The document will also outline behaviors that may violate these policies. In addition to other provisions, Harvard committed to enhancing its reporting procedures for allegations of antisemitism on campus. To ensure the effective implementation of these measures, Harvard agreed to establish a new position within the Office for Community Conduct to oversee antisemitism complaints and manage the preparation of relevant annual reports. The settlement included additional undisclosed monetary terms. As part of the settlement, Harvard did not admit to any wrongdoing or liability. The case is now closed.",
