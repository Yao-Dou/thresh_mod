    "target": "This case challenges the Trump Administration\u2019s abrupt termination of hundreds of federal grants in April 2025. On May 21, 2025, five nonprofits filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Justice, the Attorney General, and the Office of Justice Programs and its acting head. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' actions exceeded their executive authority and violated the Due Process Clause, the Take Care Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The case was assigned to District Judge Amit Mehta.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that in April 2025, defendants abruptly terminated more than 370 multi-year cooperative agreements and grants awarding more than $820 million in essential funding to the plaintiffs and other nonprofits. The terminated cooperative agreements and grants cut across a broad array of critical programs, including violence reduction and intervention, policing and prosecution, victims' services, juvenile justice and child protection, substance use and mental health treatment, and other public safety programs. Also on May 21, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, and on May 22, a motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nPlaintiffs sought both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to stop defendants from implementing their mass termination of the cooperative agreements and to restore or preserve funding for affected grantees while the case proceeded. They also sought declaratory relief, asking the court to declare that defendants\u2019 actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act because they were arbitrary and capricious, exceeded statutory authority, and failed to follow required procedures. Finally, plaintiffs requested an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs.\n\nOn June 6, 2025, a coalition of 33 amici curiae, including several local governments, filed a brief supporting plaintiffs\u2019 motion. The brief highlighted the critical importance of the terminated grants for public safety, victim services, and violence-reduction initiatives. In their response, defendants dismissed the amici curiae brief as irrelevant, arguing that the dispute concerned routine contract administration rather than a broad, unlawful policy change, and therefore did not warrant extraordinary judicial intervention.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and to deny plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. defendants argued that the court lacked jurisdiction and that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were likely to fail on the merits. Additionally, defendants contended that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction. Later that day, plaintiffs filed a supplemental brief addressing a recent Supreme Court decision (Dep\u2019t of Education v. California), which defendants had cited to argue that district courts lack jurisdiction to order payment of federal grant funds. plaintiffs argued that other forms of relief\u2014such as reinstating grants\u2014remained available.\n\nOn June 26, 2025, the court held a hearing on all pending motions, including the motions for class certification and a preliminary injunction, as well as the government\u2019s motion to dismiss. Then, on July 7, 2025, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion and dismissed the case. 2025 WL 1865160. Judge Mehta held that plaintiffs lacked a valid cause of action to compel reinstatement of federal funding under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the requested relief.\n\nHe wrote:\n\nThere is no doubt in the court\u2019s mind that OJP\u2019s award terminations were unfair and indiscriminate. When a government agency, especially the Department of Justice, agrees to fund private organizations to carry out a public purpose, such organizations expect regularity and respectful treatment. That is not what occurred here. The court laments that the limits of its own power prevent it from helping plaintiffs and similarly situated grantees. But the court cannot cure an injustice by exceeding its own authority.\n\nPlaintiffs appealed the district court\u2019s July 7 decision to the D.C. Circuit on July 8, 2025 and filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal on July 11.\n\nPlaintiffs similarly sought an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal in the district court on July 10, 2025, arguing that, despite the dismissal, the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion indicated that all factors supporting injunctive relief were present. Plaintiffs asserted that the grant terminations had already caused, and would continue to cause, severe irreparable harm, including layoffs of specialized staff, elimination of critical programs, and damage to organizational reputations. They provided specific examples of harm, such as increased homicides in King County, Washington, following the layoffs of gang outreach specialists; FORCE Detroit\u2019s inability to intervene in gun violence; HRiA\u2019s loss of resources for violence interruption efforts during the summer; and Stop AAPI Hate\u2019s accelerated layoffs and program cuts amid rising threats against Asian-Americans. plaintiffs noted that the district court itself had concluded that defendants\u2019 actions were \u201clikely to harm communities and individuals vulnerable to crime and violence.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs also argued that both the public interest and the balance of equities strongly supported injunctive relief. They noted that the district court itself had described defendants\u2019 abrupt and unexplained termination of the grants as \u201cunquestionably arbitrary,\u201d \u201cshameful,\u201d and \u201cunfair and indiscriminate.\u201d plaintiffs further emphasized that serious legal questions remained. They pointed out that the court\u2019s own opinion suggested their Administrative Procedure Act claims were likely meritorious, having found defendants\u2019 actions \u201carbitrary, at least in lay terms\u201d and \u201cindiscriminate.\u201d Although the district court denied preliminary relief based on a perceived lack of jurisdiction, it acknowledged that its conclusion was \u201cfar from obvious\u201d and that other district courts within the Circuit had interpreted the controlling Supreme Court decision (California III) differently, highlighting a substantial question warranting injunctive relief pending appeal. Finally, plaintiffs asked the court to waive any bond requirement, arguing that a bond would impede access to judicial review and further harm organizations already suffering from the funding cuts.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the district court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal but granted a narrower, stipulated injunction. The court found that plaintiffs had not met the high bar for such an \u201cextraordinary remedy,\u201d emphasizing that this was not a \u201crare\u201d case warranting that relief. It concluded the threat of irreparable harm was not \u201cso grave\u201d as to justify an affirmative injunction, noting no plaintiff claimed they would be forced to close without the funding. The court also observed that plaintiffs had not addressed the jurisdictional ruling in depth and cited no case granting an injunction pending appeal after dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. However, because the parties agreed to a more limited injunction, the court barred defendants from re-obligating or diminishing the terminated grant funds. It declined to require an injunction bond, reasoning that the order did not compel any public expenditures the government might be unable to recover.\n\nIn the appellate court, on August 1, 2025, the D.C. Circuit denied the plaintiffs' emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal, stating that the appellants did not satisfy the stringent requirements for such an injunction. Specifically, the court found that the appellants had not substantiated their claims of irreparable harm.\n\nThe case remains ongoing in the district court and the D.C. Circuit.",

They noted that the district court itself had described defendants\u2019 abrupt and unexplained termination of the grants as \u201cunquestionably arbitrary,\u201d \u201cshameful,\u201d and \u201cunfair and indiscriminate.\u201d plaintiffs further emphasized that serious legal questions remained. They pointed out that the court\u2019s own opinion suggested their Administrative Procedure Act claims were likely meritorious, having found defendants\u2019 actions \u201carbitrary, at least in lay terms\u201d and \u201cindiscriminate.\u201d Although the district court denied preliminary relief based on a perceived lack of jurisdiction, it acknowledged that its conclusion was \u201cfar from obvious\u201d and that other district courts within the Circuit had interpreted the controlling Supreme Court decision (California III) differently, highlighting a substantial question warranting injunctive relief pending appeal. Finally, plaintiffs asked the court to waive any bond requirement, arguing that a bond would impede access to judicial review and further harm organizations already suffering from the funding cuts.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the district court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal but granted a narrower, stipulated injunction. The court found that plaintiffs had not met the high bar for such an \u201cextraordinary remedy,\u201d emphasizing that this was not a \u201crare\u201d case warranting that relief. It concluded the threat of irreparable harm was not \u201cso grave\u201d as to justify an affirmative injunction, noting no plaintiff claimed they would be forced to close without the funding. The court also observed that plaintiffs had not addressed the jurisdictional ruling in depth and cited no case granting an injunction pending appeal after dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. However, because the parties agreed to a more limited injunction, the court barred defendants from re-obligating or diminishing the terminated grant funds. It declined to require an injunction bond, reasoning that the order did not compel any public expenditures the government might be unable to recover.\n\nIn the appellate court, on August 1, 2025, the D.C.

    "target": "This case challenges the Trump Administration\u2019s abrupt termination of hundreds of federal grants in April 2025. On May 21, 2025, five nonprofits filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Justice, the Attorney General, and the Office of Justice Programs and its acting head. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' actions exceeded their executive authority and violated the Due Process Clause, the Take Care Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The case was assigned to District Judge Amit Mehta.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that in April 2025, defendants abruptly terminated more than 370 multi-year cooperative agreements and grants awarding more than $820 million in essential funding to the plaintiffs and other nonprofits. The terminated cooperative agreements and grants cut across a broad array of critical programs, including violence reduction and intervention, policing and prosecution, victims' services, juvenile justice and child protection, substance use and mental health treatment, and other public safety programs. Also on May 21, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, and on May 22, a motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nPlaintiffs sought both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to stop defendants from implementing their mass termination of the cooperative agreements and to restore or preserve funding for affected grantees while the case proceeded. They also sought declaratory relief, asking the court to declare that defendants\u2019 actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act because they were arbitrary and capricious, exceeded statutory authority, and failed to follow required procedures. Finally, plaintiffs requested an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs.\n\nOn June 6, 2025, a coalition of 33 amici curiae, including several local governments, filed a brief supporting plaintiffs\u2019 motion. The brief highlighted the critical importance of the terminated grants for public safety, victim services, and violence-reduction initiatives. In their response, defendants dismissed the amici curiae brief as irrelevant, arguing that the dispute concerned routine contract administration rather than a broad, unlawful policy change, and therefore did not warrant extraordinary judicial intervention.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and to deny plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. defendants argued that the court lacked jurisdiction and that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were likely to fail on the merits. Additionally, defendants contended that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction. Later that day, plaintiffs filed a supplemental brief addressing a recent Supreme Court decision (Dep\u2019t of Education v. California), which defendants had cited to argue that district courts lack jurisdiction to order payment of federal grant funds. plaintiffs argued that other forms of relief\u2014such as reinstating grants\u2014remained available.\n\nOn June 26, 2025, the court held a hearing on all pending motions, including the motions for class certification and a preliminary injunction, as well as the government\u2019s motion to dismiss. Then, on July 7, 2025, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion and dismissed the case. 2025 WL 1865160. Judge Mehta held that plaintiffs lacked a valid cause of action to compel reinstatement of federal funding under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the requested relief.\n\nHe wrote:\n\nThere is no doubt in the court\u2019s mind that OJP\u2019s award terminations were unfair and indiscriminate. When a government agency, especially the Department of Justice, agrees to fund private organizations to carry out a public purpose, such organizations expect regularity and respectful treatment. That is not what occurred here. The court laments that the limits of its own power prevent it from helping plaintiffs and similarly situated grantees. But the court cannot cure an injustice by exceeding its own authority.\n\nPlaintiffs appealed the district court\u2019s July 7 decision to the D.C. Circuit on July 8, 2025 and filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal on July 11.\n\nPlaintiffs similarly sought an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal in the district court on July 10, 2025, arguing that, despite the dismissal, the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion indicated that all factors supporting injunctive relief were present. Plaintiffs asserted that the grant terminations had already caused, and would continue to cause, severe irreparable harm, including layoffs of specialized staff, elimination of critical programs, and damage to organizational reputations.

    "target": "This case challenges the Trump Administration\u2019s abrupt termination of hundreds of federal grants in April 2025. On May 21, 2025, five nonprofits filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Justice, the Attorney General, and the Office of Justice Programs and its acting head. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' actions exceeded their executive authority and violated the Due Process Clause, the Take Care Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The case was assigned to District Judge Amit Mehta.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that in April 2025, defendants abruptly terminated more than 370 multi-year cooperative agreements and grants awarding more than $820 million in essential funding to the plaintiffs and other nonprofits. The terminated cooperative agreements and grants cut across a broad array of critical programs, including violence reduction and intervention, policing and prosecution, victims' services, juvenile justice and child protection, substance use and mental health treatment, and other public safety programs. Also on May 21, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, and on May 22, a motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nPlaintiffs sought both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to stop defendants from implementing their mass termination of the cooperative agreements and to restore or preserve funding for affected grantees while the case proceeded. They also sought declaratory relief, asking the court to declare that defendants\u2019 actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act because they were arbitrary and capricious, exceeded statutory authority, and failed to follow required procedures. Finally, plaintiffs requested an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs.\n\nOn June 6, 2025, a coalition of 33 amici curiae, including several local governments, filed a brief supporting plaintiffs\u2019 motion. The brief highlighted the critical importance of the terminated grants for public safety, victim services, and violence-reduction initiatives. In their response, defendants dismissed the amici curiae brief as irrelevant, arguing that the dispute concerned routine contract administration rather than a broad, unlawful policy change, and therefore did not warrant extraordinary judicial intervention.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and to deny plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. defendants argued that the court lacked jurisdiction and that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were likely to fail on the merits. Additionally, defendants contended that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction. Later that day, plaintiffs filed a supplemental brief addressing a recent Supreme Court decision (Dep\u2019t of Education v. California), which defendants had cited to argue that district courts lack jurisdiction to order payment of federal grant funds. plaintiffs argued that other forms of relief\u2014such as reinstating grants\u2014remained available.\n\nOn June 26, 2025, the court held a hearing on all pending motions, including the motions for class certification and a preliminary injunction, as well as the government\u2019s motion to dismiss. Then, on July 7, 2025, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion and dismissed the case. 2025 WL 1865160. Judge Mehta held that plaintiffs lacked a valid cause of action to compel reinstatement of federal funding under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the requested relief.\n\nHe wrote:\n\nThere is no doubt in the court\u2019s mind that OJP\u2019s award terminations were unfair and indiscriminate. When a government agency, especially the Department of Justice, agrees to fund private organizations to carry out a public purpose, such organizations expect regularity and respectful treatment. That is not what occurred here. The court laments that the limits of its own power prevent it from helping plaintiffs and similarly situated grantees. But the court cannot cure an injustice by exceeding its own authority.\n\nPlaintiffs appealed the district court\u2019s July 7 decision to the D.C. Circuit on July 8, 2025 and filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal on July 11.\n\nPlaintiffs similarly sought an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal in the district court on July 10, 2025, arguing that, despite the dismissal, the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion indicated that all factors supporting injunctive relief were present. Plaintiffs asserted that the grant terminations had already caused, and would continue to cause, severe irreparable harm, including layoffs of specialized staff, elimination of critical programs, and damage to organizational reputations. They provided specific examples of harm, such as increased homicides in King County, Washington, following the layoffs of gang outreach specialists; FORCE Detroit\u2019s inability to intervene in gun violence; HRiA\u2019s loss of resources for violence interruption efforts during the summer; and Stop AAPI Hate\u2019s accelerated layoffs and program cuts amid rising threats against Asian-Americans. plaintiffs noted that the district court itself had concluded that defendants\u2019 actions were \u201clikely to harm communities and individuals vulnerable to crime and violence.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs also argued that both the public interest and the balance of equities strongly supported injunctive relief. They noted that the district court itself had described defendants\u2019 abrupt and unexplained termination of the grants as \u201cunquestionably arbitrary,\u201d \u201cshameful,\u201d and \u201cunfair and indiscriminate.\u201d plaintiffs further emphasized that serious legal questions remained. They pointed out that the court\u2019s own opinion suggested their Administrative Procedure Act claims were likely meritorious, having found defendants\u2019 actions \u201carbitrary, at least in lay terms\u201d and \u201cindiscriminate.\u201d Although the district court denied preliminary relief based on a perceived lack of jurisdiction, it acknowledged that its conclusion was \u201cfar from obvious\u201d and that other district courts within the Circuit had interpreted the controlling Supreme Court decision (California III) differently, highlighting a substantial question warranting injunctive relief pending appeal. Finally, plaintiffs asked the court to waive any bond requirement, arguing that a bond would impede access to judicial review and further harm organizations already suffering from the funding cuts.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the district court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal but granted a narrower, stipulated injunction. The court found that plaintiffs had not met the high bar for such an \u201cextraordinary remedy,\u201d emphasizing that this was not a \u201crare\u201d case warranting that relief. It concluded the threat of irreparable harm was not \u201cso grave\u201d as to justify an affirmative injunction, noting no plaintiff claimed they would be forced to close without the funding. The court also observed that plaintiffs had not addressed the jurisdictional ruling in depth and cited no case granting an injunction pending appeal after dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. However, because the parties agreed to a more limited injunction, the court barred defendants from re-obligating or diminishing the terminated grant funds. It declined to require an injunction bond, reasoning that the order did not compel any public expenditures the government might be unable to recover.\n\nIn the appellate court, on August 1, 2025, the D.C. Circuit denied the plaintiffs' emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal, stating that the appellants did not satisfy the stringent requirements for such an injunction. Specifically, the court found that the appellants had not substantiated their claims of irreparable harm.\n\nThe case remains ongoing in the district court and the D.C. Circuit.",

    "target": "This case challenges the Trump Administration\u2019s abrupt termination of hundreds of federal grants in April 2025. On May 21, 2025, five nonprofits filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Justice, the Attorney General, and the Office of Justice Programs and its acting head. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' actions exceeded their executive authority and violated the Due Process Clause, the Take Care Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The case was assigned to District Judge Amit Mehta.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that in April 2025, defendants abruptly terminated more than 370 multi-year cooperative agreements and grants awarding more than $820 million in essential funding to the plaintiffs and other nonprofits. The terminated cooperative agreements and grants cut across a broad array of critical programs, including violence reduction and intervention, policing and prosecution, victims' services, juvenile justice and child protection, substance use and mental health treatment, and other public safety programs. Also on May 21, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, and on May 22, a motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nPlaintiffs sought both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to stop defendants from implementing their mass termination of the cooperative agreements and to restore or preserve funding for affected grantees while the case proceeded. They also sought declaratory relief, asking the court to declare that defendants\u2019 actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act because they were arbitrary and capricious, exceeded statutory authority, and failed to follow required procedures. Finally, plaintiffs requested an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs.\n\nOn June 6, 2025, a coalition of 33 amici curiae, including several local governments, filed a brief supporting plaintiffs\u2019 motion. The brief highlighted the critical importance of the terminated grants for public safety, victim services, and violence-reduction initiatives. In their response, defendants dismissed the amici curiae brief as irrelevant, arguing that the dispute concerned routine contract administration rather than a broad, unlawful policy change, and therefore did not warrant extraordinary judicial intervention.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and to deny plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. defendants argued that the court lacked jurisdiction and that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were likely to fail on the merits. Additionally, defendants contended that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction. Later that day, plaintiffs filed a supplemental brief addressing a recent Supreme Court decision (Dep\u2019t of Education v. California), which defendants had cited to argue that district courts lack jurisdiction to order payment of federal grant funds. plaintiffs argued that other forms of relief\u2014such as reinstating grants\u2014remained available.\n\nOn June 26, 2025, the court held a hearing on all pending motions, including the motions for class certification and a preliminary injunction, as well as the government\u2019s motion to dismiss. Then, on July 7, 2025, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion and dismissed the case. 2025 WL 1865160. Judge Mehta held that plaintiffs lacked a valid cause of action to compel reinstatement of federal funding under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the requested relief.\n\nHe wrote:\n\nThere is no doubt in the court\u2019s mind that OJP\u2019s award terminations were unfair and indiscriminate. When a government agency, especially the Department of Justice, agrees to fund private organizations to carry out a public purpose, such organizations expect regularity and respectful treatment. That is not what occurred here. The court laments that the limits of its own power prevent it from helping plaintiffs and similarly situated grantees. But the court cannot cure an injustice by exceeding its own authority.\n\nPlaintiffs appealed the district court\u2019s July 7 decision to the D.C. Circuit on July 8, 2025 and filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal on July 11.\n\nPlaintiffs similarly sought an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal in the district court on July 10, 2025, arguing that, despite the dismissal, the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion indicated that all factors supporting injunctive relief were present. Plaintiffs asserted that the grant terminations had already caused, and would continue to cause, severe irreparable harm, including layoffs of specialized staff, elimination of critical programs, and damage to organizational reputations. They provided specific examples of harm, such as increased homicides in King County, Washington, following the layoffs of gang outreach specialists; FORCE Detroit\u2019s inability to intervene in gun violence; HRiA\u2019s loss of resources for violence interruption efforts during the summer; and Stop AAPI Hate\u2019s accelerated layoffs and program cuts amid rising threats against Asian-Americans. plaintiffs noted that the district court itself had concluded that defendants\u2019 actions were \u201clikely to harm communities and individuals vulnerable to crime and violence.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs also argued that both the public interest and the balance of equities strongly supported injunctive relief. They noted that the district court itself had described defendants\u2019 abrupt and unexplained termination of the grants as \u201cunquestionably arbitrary,\u201d \u201cshameful,\u201d and \u201cunfair and indiscriminate.\u201d plaintiffs further emphasized that serious legal questions remained. They pointed out that the court\u2019s own opinion suggested their Administrative Procedure Act claims were likely meritorious, having found defendants\u2019 actions \u201carbitrary, at least in lay terms\u201d and \u201cindiscriminate.\u201d Although the district court denied preliminary relief based on a perceived lack of jurisdiction, it acknowledged that its conclusion was \u201cfar from obvious\u201d and that other district courts within the Circuit had interpreted the controlling Supreme Court decision (California III) differently, highlighting a substantial question warranting injunctive relief pending appeal. Finally, plaintiffs asked the court to waive any bond requirement, arguing that a bond would impede access to judicial review and further harm organizations already suffering from the funding cuts.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the district court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal but granted a narrower, stipulated injunction. The court found that plaintiffs had not met the high bar for such an \u201cextraordinary remedy,\u201d emphasizing that this was not a \u201crare\u201d case warranting that relief. It concluded the threat of irreparable harm was not \u201cso grave\u201d as to justify an affirmative injunction, noting no plaintiff claimed they would be forced to close without the funding. The court also observed that plaintiffs had not addressed the jurisdictional ruling in depth and cited no case granting an injunction pending appeal after dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. However, because the parties agreed to a more limited injunction, the court barred defendants from re-obligating or diminishing the terminated grant funds. It declined to require an injunction bond, reasoning that the order did not compel any public expenditures the government might be unable to recover.\n\nIn the appellate court, on August 1, 2025, the D.C. Circuit denied the plaintiffs' emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal, stating that the appellants did not satisfy the stringent requirements for such an injunction. Specifically, the court found that the appellants had not substantiated their claims of irreparable harm.\n\nThe case remains ongoing in the district court and the D.C. Circuit.",

    "target": "This case challenges the Trump Administration\u2019s abrupt termination of hundreds of federal grants in April 2025. On May 21, 2025, five nonprofits filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Justice, the Attorney General, and the Office of Justice Programs and its acting head. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' actions exceeded their executive authority and violated the Due Process Clause, the Take Care Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The case was assigned to District Judge Amit Mehta.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that in April 2025, defendants abruptly terminated more than 370 multi-year cooperative agreements and grants awarding more than $820 million in essential funding to the plaintiffs and other nonprofits. The terminated cooperative agreements and grants cut across a broad array of critical programs, including violence reduction and intervention, policing and prosecution, victims' services, juvenile justice and child protection, substance use and mental health treatment, and other public safety programs. Also on May 21, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, and on May 22, a motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nPlaintiffs sought both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to stop defendants from implementing their mass termination of the cooperative agreements and to restore or preserve funding for affected grantees while the case proceeded. They also sought declaratory relief, asking the court to declare that defendants\u2019 actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act because they were arbitrary and capricious, exceeded statutory authority, and failed to follow required procedures. Finally, plaintiffs requested an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs.\n\nOn June 6, 2025, a coalition of 33 amici curiae, including several local governments, filed a brief supporting plaintiffs\u2019 motion. The brief highlighted the critical importance of the terminated grants for public safety, victim services, and violence-reduction initiatives. In their response, defendants dismissed the amici curiae brief as irrelevant, arguing that the dispute concerned routine contract administration rather than a broad, unlawful policy change, and therefore did not warrant extraordinary judicial intervention.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and to deny plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. defendants argued that the court lacked jurisdiction and that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were likely to fail on the merits. Additionally, defendants contended that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction. Later that day, plaintiffs filed a supplemental brief addressing a recent Supreme Court decision (Dep\u2019t of Education v. California), which defendants had cited to argue that district courts lack jurisdiction to order payment of federal grant funds. plaintiffs argued that other forms of relief\u2014such as reinstating grants\u2014remained available.\n\nOn June 26, 2025, the court held a hearing on all pending motions, including the motions for class certification and a preliminary injunction, as well as the government\u2019s motion to dismiss. Then, on July 7, 2025, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion and dismissed the case. 2025 WL 1865160. Judge Mehta held that plaintiffs lacked a valid cause of action to compel reinstatement of federal funding under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the requested relief.\n\nHe wrote:\n\nThere is no doubt in the court\u2019s mind that OJP\u2019s award terminations were unfair and indiscriminate. When a government agency, especially the Department of Justice, agrees to fund private organizations to carry out a public purpose, such organizations expect regularity and respectful treatment. That is not what occurred here. The court laments that the limits of its own power prevent it from helping plaintiffs and similarly situated grantees. But the court cannot cure an injustice by exceeding its own authority.\n\nPlaintiffs appealed the district court\u2019s July 7 decision to the D.C. Circuit on July 8, 2025 and filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal on July 11.\n\nPlaintiffs similarly sought an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal in the district court on July 10, 2025, arguing that, despite the dismissal, the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion indicated that all factors supporting injunctive relief were present. Plaintiffs asserted that the grant terminations had already caused, and would continue to cause, severe irreparable harm, including layoffs of specialized staff, elimination of critical programs, and damage to organizational reputations. They provided specific examples of harm, such as increased homicides in King County, Washington, following the layoffs of gang outreach specialists; FORCE Detroit\u2019s inability to intervene in gun violence; HRiA\u2019s loss of resources for violence interruption efforts during the summer; and Stop AAPI Hate\u2019s accelerated layoffs and program cuts amid rising threats against Asian-Americans. plaintiffs noted that the district court itself had concluded that defendants\u2019 actions were \u201clikely to harm communities and individuals vulnerable to crime and violence.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs also argued that both the public interest and the balance of equities strongly supported injunctive relief. They noted that the district court itself had described defendants\u2019 abrupt and unexplained termination of the grants as \u201cunquestionably arbitrary,\u201d \u201cshameful,\u201d and \u201cunfair and indiscriminate.\u201d plaintiffs further emphasized that serious legal questions remained. They pointed out that the court\u2019s own opinion suggested their Administrative Procedure Act claims were likely meritorious, having found defendants\u2019 actions \u201carbitrary, at least in lay terms\u201d and \u201cindiscriminate.\u201d Although the district court denied preliminary relief based on a perceived lack of jurisdiction, it acknowledged that its conclusion was \u201cfar from obvious\u201d and that other district courts within the Circuit had interpreted the controlling Supreme Court decision (California III) differently, highlighting a substantial question warranting injunctive relief pending appeal. Finally, plaintiffs asked the court to waive any bond requirement, arguing that a bond would impede access to judicial review and further harm organizations already suffering from the funding cuts.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the district court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal but granted a narrower, stipulated injunction. The court found that plaintiffs had not met the high bar for such an \u201cextraordinary remedy,\u201d emphasizing that this was not a \u201crare\u201d case warranting that relief. It concluded the threat of irreparable harm was not \u201cso grave\u201d as to justify an affirmative injunction, noting no plaintiff claimed they would be forced to close without the funding. The court also observed that plaintiffs had not addressed the jurisdictional ruling in depth and cited no case granting an injunction pending appeal after dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. However, because the parties agreed to a more limited injunction, the court barred defendants from re-obligating or diminishing the terminated grant funds. It declined to require an injunction bond, reasoning that the order did not compel any public expenditures the government might be unable to recover.\n\nIn the appellate court, on August 1, 2025, the D.C. Circuit denied the plaintiffs' emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal, stating that the appellants did not satisfy the stringent requirements for such an injunction. Specifically, the court found that the appellants had not substantiated their claims of irreparable harm.\n\nThe case remains ongoing in the district court and the D.C. Circuit.",

In their response, defendants dismissed the amici curiae brief as irrelevant, arguing that the dispute concerned routine contract administration rather than a broad, unlawful policy change, and therefore did not warrant extraordinary judicial intervention.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and to deny plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. defendants argued that the court lacked jurisdiction and that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were likely to fail on the merits. Additionally, defendants contended that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction. Later that day, plaintiffs filed a supplemental brief addressing a recent Supreme Court decision (Dep\u2019t of Education v. California), which defendants had cited to argue that district courts lack jurisdiction to order payment of federal grant funds. plaintiffs argued that other forms of relief\u2014such as reinstating grants\u2014remained available.\n\nOn June 26, 2025, the court held a hearing on all pending motions, including the motions for class certification and a preliminary injunction, as well as the government\u2019s motion to dismiss. Then, on July 7, 2025, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion and dismissed the case. 2025 WL 1865160. Judge Mehta held that plaintiffs lacked a valid cause of action to compel reinstatement of federal funding under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the requested relief.\n\nHe wrote:\n\nThere is no doubt in the court\u2019s mind that OJP\u2019s award terminations were unfair and indiscriminate. When a government agency, especially the Department of Justice, agrees to fund private organizations to carry out a public purpose, such organizations expect regularity and respectful treatment. That is not what occurred here. The court laments that the limits of its own power prevent it from helping plaintiffs and similarly situated grantees. But the court cannot cure an injustice by exceeding its own authority.\n\nPlaintiffs appealed the district court\u2019s July 7 decision to the D.C. Circuit on July 8, 2025 and filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal on July 11.\n\nPlaintiffs similarly sought an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal in the district court on July 10, 2025, arguing that, despite the dismissal, the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion indicated that all factors supporting injunctive relief were present. Plaintiffs asserted that the grant terminations had already caused, and would continue to cause, severe irreparable harm, including layoffs of specialized staff, elimination of critical programs, and damage to organizational reputations. They provided specific examples of harm, such as increased homicides in King County, Washington, following the layoffs of gang outreach specialists; FORCE Detroit\u2019s inability to intervene in gun violence; HRiA\u2019s loss of resources for violence interruption efforts during the summer; and Stop AAPI Hate\u2019s accelerated layoffs and program cuts amid rising threats against Asian-Americans. plaintiffs noted that the district court itself had concluded that defendants\u2019 actions were \u201clikely to harm communities and individuals vulnerable to crime and violence.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs also argued that both the public interest and the balance of equities strongly supported injunctive relief. They noted that the district court itself had described defendants\u2019 abrupt and unexplained termination of the grants as \u201cunquestionably arbitrary,\u201d \u201cshameful,\u201d and \u201cunfair and indiscriminate.\u201d plaintiffs further emphasized that serious legal questions remained. They pointed out that the court\u2019s own opinion suggested their Administrative Procedure Act claims were likely meritorious, having found defendants\u2019 actions \u201carbitrary, at least in lay terms\u201d and \u201cindiscriminate.\u201d Although the district court denied preliminary relief based on a perceived lack of jurisdiction, it acknowledged that its conclusion was \u201cfar from obvious\u201d and that other district courts within the Circuit had interpreted the controlling Supreme Court decision (California III) differently, highlighting a substantial question warranting injunctive relief pending appeal. Finally, plaintiffs asked the court to waive any bond requirement, arguing that a bond would impede access to judicial review and further harm organizations already suffering from the funding cuts.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the district court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal but granted a narrower, stipulated injunction. The court found that plaintiffs had not met the high bar for such an \u201cextraordinary remedy,\u201d emphasizing that this was not a \u201crare\u201d case warranting that relief. It concluded the threat of irreparable harm was not \u201cso grave\u201d as to justify an affirmative injunction, noting no plaintiff claimed they would be forced to close without the funding. The court also observed that plaintiffs had not addressed the jurisdictional ruling in depth and cited no case granting an injunction pending appeal after dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. However, because the parties agreed to a more limited injunction, the court barred defendants from re-obligating or diminishing the terminated grant funds. It declined to require an injunction bond, reasoning that the order did not compel any public expenditures the government might be unable to recover.\n\nIn the appellate court, on August 1, 2025, the D.C. Circuit denied the plaintiffs' emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal, stating that the appellants did not satisfy the stringent requirements for such an injunction. Specifically, the court found that the appellants had not substantiated their claims of irreparable harm.\n\nThe case remains ongoing in the district court and the D.C. Circuit.",

On May 21, 2025, five nonprofits filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Justice, the Attorney General, and the Office of Justice Programs and its acting head. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' actions exceeded their executive authority and violated the Due Process Clause, the Take Care Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The case was assigned to District Judge Amit Mehta.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that in April 2025, defendants abruptly terminated more than 370 multi-year cooperative agreements and grants awarding more than $820 million in essential funding to the plaintiffs and other nonprofits. The terminated cooperative agreements and grants cut across a broad array of critical programs, including violence reduction and intervention, policing and prosecution, victims' services, juvenile justice and child protection, substance use and mental health treatment, and other public safety programs. Also on May 21, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, and on May 22, a motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nPlaintiffs sought both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to stop defendants from implementing their mass termination of the cooperative agreements and to restore or preserve funding for affected grantees while the case proceeded. They also sought declaratory relief, asking the court to declare that defendants\u2019 actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act because they were arbitrary and capricious, exceeded statutory authority, and failed to follow required procedures.

In their response, defendants dismissed the amici curiae brief as irrelevant, arguing that the dispute concerned routine contract administration rather than a broad, unlawful policy change, and therefore did not warrant extraordinary judicial intervention.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and to deny plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. defendants argued that the court lacked jurisdiction and that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were likely to fail on the merits. Additionally, defendants contended that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction. Later that day, plaintiffs filed a supplemental brief addressing a recent Supreme Court decision (Dep\u2019t of Education v. California), which defendants had cited to argue that district courts lack jurisdiction to order payment of federal grant funds. plaintiffs argued that other forms of relief\u2014such as reinstating grants\u2014remained available.\n\nOn June 26, 2025, the court held a hearing on all pending motions, including the motions for class certification and a preliminary injunction, as well as the government\u2019s motion to dismiss. Then, on July 7, 2025, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion and dismissed the case. 2025 WL 1865160. Judge Mehta held that plaintiffs lacked a valid cause of action to compel reinstatement of federal funding under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the requested relief.\n\nHe wrote:\n\nThere is no doubt in the court\u2019s mind that OJP\u2019s award terminations were unfair and indiscriminate. When a government agency, especially the Department of Justice, agrees to fund private organizations to carry out a public purpose, such organizations expect regularity and respectful treatment. That is not what occurred here. The court laments that the limits of its own power prevent it from helping plaintiffs and similarly situated grantees. But the court cannot cure an injustice by exceeding its own authority.\n\nPlaintiffs appealed the district court\u2019s July 7 decision to the D.C. Circuit on July 8, 2025 and filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal on July 11.\n\nPlaintiffs similarly sought an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal in the district court on July 10, 2025, arguing that, despite the dismissal, the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion indicated that all factors supporting injunctive relief were present. Plaintiffs asserted that the grant terminations had already caused, and would continue to cause, severe irreparable harm, including layoffs of specialized staff, elimination of critical programs, and damage to organizational reputations. They provided specific examples of harm, such as increased homicides in King County, Washington, following the layoffs of gang outreach specialists; FORCE Detroit\u2019s inability to intervene in gun violence; HRiA\u2019s loss of resources for violence interruption efforts during the summer; and Stop AAPI Hate\u2019s accelerated layoffs and program cuts amid rising threats against Asian-Americans. plaintiffs noted that the district court itself had concluded that defendants\u2019 actions were \u201clikely to harm communities and individuals vulnerable to crime and violence.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs also argued that both the public interest and the balance of equities strongly supported injunctive relief. They noted that the district court itself had described defendants\u2019 abrupt and unexplained termination of the grants as \u201cunquestionably arbitrary,\u201d \u201cshameful,\u201d and \u201cunfair and indiscriminate.\u201d plaintiffs further emphasized that serious legal questions remained. They pointed out that the court\u2019s own opinion suggested their Administrative Procedure Act claims were likely meritorious, having found defendants\u2019 actions \u201carbitrary, at least in lay terms\u201d and \u201cindiscriminate.\u201d Although the district court denied preliminary relief based on a perceived lack of jurisdiction, it acknowledged that its conclusion was \u201cfar from obvious\u201d and that other district courts within the Circuit had interpreted the controlling Supreme Court decision (California III) differently, highlighting a substantial question warranting injunctive relief pending appeal. Finally, plaintiffs asked the court to waive any bond requirement, arguing that a bond would impede access to judicial review and further harm organizations already suffering from the funding cuts.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the district court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal but granted a narrower, stipulated injunction. The court found that plaintiffs had not met the high bar for such an \u201cextraordinary remedy,\u201d emphasizing that this was not a \u201crare\u201d case warranting that relief. It concluded the threat of irreparable harm was not \u201cso grave\u201d as to justify an affirmative injunction, noting no plaintiff claimed they would be forced to close without the funding. The court also observed that plaintiffs had not addressed the jurisdictional ruling in depth and cited no case granting an injunction pending appeal after dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. However, because the parties agreed to a more limited injunction, the court barred defendants from re-obligating or diminishing the terminated grant funds. It declined to require an injunction bond, reasoning that the order did not compel any public expenditures the government might be unable to recover.\n\nIn the appellate court, on August 1, 2025, the D.C. Circuit denied the plaintiffs' emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal, stating that the appellants did not satisfy the stringent requirements for such an injunction. Specifically, the court found that the appellants had not substantiated their claims of irreparable harm.\n\nThe case remains ongoing in the district court and the D.C. Circuit.",
