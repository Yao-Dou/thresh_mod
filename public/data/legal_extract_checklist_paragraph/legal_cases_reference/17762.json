    "target": "After a two-year investigation initiated in December 2016 under CRIPA and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a Notice on December 19, 2018 concluding that the Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority (\u201cHRRJ\u201d) failed to provide constitutionally adequate medical and mental health care to incarcerated peoples and placed people with serious mental illness in restrictive housing for prolonged periods of time. The DOJ also concluded that HRRJ\u2019s housing practices discriminate against incarcerated people with mental health disabilities in violation of the ADA.\n\nIn the Notice, the DOJ set forth factual findings about the conditions at HRRJ that violated incarcerated peoples\u2019 constitutional rights. Principally, the DOJ found that medical and mental health care at HRRJ was constitutionally inadequate. In all stages of medical and mental health care (including patient intake, chronic care and emergency care, treatment and therapy, continuity of care, and security and care for suicidal persons), the quality of care and access to care was found to be severely deficient, subjecting patients to a serious risk of harm due to delays and lack of care. The DOJ also found a lack of oversight and accountability and a deliberate indifference by HRRJ officials in identifying and mitigating risks. Furthermore, HRRJ utilized prolonged restrictive housing which disparately affects incarcerated people with mental illnesses, thereby denying them access to activities and programming that they would otherwise be eligible for, and putting them at risk for serious harm. Officials at HRRJ knew of these substantial shortcomings and the associated risks and failed to take appropriate action.\n\nOn August 5, 2020, the DOJ filed this lawsuit against HRRJ in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia based on the findings in the December 2018 report and HRRJ\u2019s subsequent failure to take sufficient remedial steps. The DOJ alleges that HRRJ\u2019s policies and practices violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of people incarcerated in the facility. As a result, the DOJ asked Judge Rebecca Beach Smith to declare that HRRJ\u2019s practices violated the constitutional rights of incarcerated persons and violated the ADA, and to enjoin HRRJ to take immediate action to amend its policies and practices to ensure lawful conditions of confinement.\n\nBy the time that the complaint was filed, the parties had already negotiated a settlement. On the same day as the complaint was filed, the parties filed a joint settlement motion. In the settlement agreement, HRRJ agreed to implement a comprehensive list of reforms including appropriate screening and assessment for medical and mental health needs by qualified professionals, adequate treatment planning for medical and mental health concerns, suicide prevention practices, specialized mental health housing units, oversight of restrictive housing placement, increased medical and mental health staff, increased training for staff, increased collaboration between mental health staff and jail leadership, and a Quality Assurance program to identify and correct deficiencies with the medical and mental health care system to be overseen by a Quality Assurance Committee providing monthly reports to the monitor and the DOJ.\n\nThe settlement agreement noted that HRRJ would designate an Agreement Coordinator to coordinate compliance with the agreement. HRRJ agreed to create annual Implementation Plans to describe how it will fulfill its obligations under the agreement, including deadlines within the first year by which HRRJ must draft or revise policies and procedures, complete a staffing plan, develop and deliver training to HRRJ staff, develop and implement a Quality Improvement Committee, and develop and implement monthly quality assurance mechanisms to report on data relevant to prevent to prevent or minimize harm to incarcerated persons.\n\nA key provision of the settlement agreement was the mandatory appointment of an independent third-party monitor, to oversee HRRJ\u2019s compliance with the agreement. The monitor was agreed to be retained for a period of three years and provide biannual status reports to the DOJ, HRRJ and the court. The monitor would also undertake compliance reviews, on-site inspections and issue monitor reports every six months to assess compliance and HRRJ\u2019s progress on the various reform efforts. The reports will also be filed with the court. In the event of noncompliance with the agreement, the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia retained jurisdiction to enforce the agreement at the request of the DOJ.\n\nOn August 31, 2020, the court approved the settlement agreement and subsequently, on September 10, 2020, the court approved the appointment of James Conrad Welch to be the third-party monitor. The settlement agreement was effective as of August 31, 2020.\n\nBy the terms of the agreement, HRRJ was to implement all provisions of the agreement within four years and the agreement would terminate in five years, so long as HRRJ attained substantial compliance with the agreement and maintained that compliance for at least one year. HRRJ had the burden to prove that it has achieved and maintained substantial compliance with the agreement and has been operating in accordance with the requirements of the ADA and the U.S. Constitution continuously for one year. After the closure of the facility on April 1, 2024, and the filing of the final monitor\u2019s report on June 4, 2024, the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss the agreement on July 31, 2024. The court dismissed the agreement on the same day, and the case is now closed.",

    "target": "After a two-year investigation initiated in December 2016 under CRIPA and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a Notice on December 19, 2018 concluding that the Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority (\u201cHRRJ\u201d) failed to provide constitutionally adequate medical and mental health care to incarcerated peoples and placed people with serious mental illness in restrictive housing for prolonged periods of time. The DOJ also concluded that HRRJ\u2019s housing practices discriminate against incarcerated people with mental health disabilities in violation of the ADA.\n\nIn the Notice, the DOJ set forth factual findings about the conditions at HRRJ that violated incarcerated peoples\u2019 constitutional rights. Principally, the DOJ found that medical and mental health care at HRRJ was constitutionally inadequate. In all stages of medical and mental health care (including patient intake, chronic care and emergency care, treatment and therapy, continuity of care, and security and care for suicidal persons), the quality of care and access to care was found to be severely deficient, subjecting patients to a serious risk of harm due to delays and lack of care. The DOJ also found a lack of oversight and accountability and a deliberate indifference by HRRJ officials in identifying and mitigating risks. Furthermore, HRRJ utilized prolonged restrictive housing which disparately affects incarcerated people with mental illnesses, thereby denying them access to activities and programming that they would otherwise be eligible for, and putting them at risk for serious harm. Officials at HRRJ knew of these substantial shortcomings and the associated risks and failed to take appropriate action.\n\nOn August 5, 2020, the DOJ filed this lawsuit against HRRJ in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia based on the findings in the December 2018 report and HRRJ\u2019s subsequent failure to take sufficient remedial steps. The DOJ alleges that HRRJ\u2019s policies and practices violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of people incarcerated in the facility. As a result, the DOJ asked Judge Rebecca Beach Smith to declare that HRRJ\u2019s practices violated the constitutional rights of incarcerated persons and violated the ADA, and to enjoin HRRJ to take immediate action to amend its policies and practices to ensure lawful conditions of confinement.\n\nBy the time that the complaint was filed, the parties had already negotiated a settlement. On the same day as the complaint was filed, the parties filed a joint settlement motion. In the settlement agreement, HRRJ agreed to implement a comprehensive list of reforms including appropriate screening and assessment for medical and mental health needs by qualified professionals, adequate treatment planning for medical and mental health concerns, suicide prevention practices, specialized mental health housing units, oversight of restrictive housing placement, increased medical and mental health staff, increased training for staff, increased collaboration between mental health staff and jail leadership, and a Quality Assurance program to identify and correct deficiencies with the medical and mental health care system to be overseen by a Quality Assurance Committee providing monthly reports to the monitor and the DOJ.\n\nThe settlement agreement noted that HRRJ would designate an Agreement Coordinator to coordinate compliance with the agreement. HRRJ agreed to create annual Implementation Plans to describe how it will fulfill its obligations under the agreement, including deadlines within the first year by which HRRJ must draft or revise policies and procedures, complete a staffing plan, develop and deliver training to HRRJ staff, develop and implement a Quality Improvement Committee, and develop and implement monthly quality assurance mechanisms to report on data relevant to prevent to prevent or minimize harm to incarcerated persons.\n\nA key provision of the settlement agreement was the mandatory appointment of an independent third-party monitor, to oversee HRRJ\u2019s compliance with the agreement. The monitor was agreed to be retained for a period of three years and provide biannual status reports to the DOJ, HRRJ and the court. The monitor would also undertake compliance reviews, on-site inspections and issue monitor reports every six months to assess compliance and HRRJ\u2019s progress on the various reform efforts. The reports will also be filed with the court. In the event of noncompliance with the agreement, the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia retained jurisdiction to enforce the agreement at the request of the DOJ.\n\nOn August 31, 2020, the court approved the settlement agreement and subsequently, on September 10, 2020, the court approved the appointment of James Conrad Welch to be the third-party monitor. The settlement agreement was effective as of August 31, 2020.\n\nBy the terms of the agreement, HRRJ was to implement all provisions of the agreement within four years and the agreement would terminate in five years, so long as HRRJ attained substantial compliance with the agreement and maintained that compliance for at least one year. HRRJ had the burden to prove that it has achieved and maintained substantial compliance with the agreement and has been operating in accordance with the requirements of the ADA and the U.S. Constitution continuously for one year. After the closure of the facility on April 1, 2024, and the filing of the final monitor\u2019s report on June 4, 2024, the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss the agreement on July 31, 2024. The court dismissed the agreement on the same day, and the case is now closed.",

In all stages of medical and mental health care (including patient intake, chronic care and emergency care, treatment and therapy, continuity of care, and security and care for suicidal persons), the quality of care and access to care was found to be severely deficient, subjecting patients to a serious risk of harm due to delays and lack of care. The DOJ also found a lack of oversight and accountability and a deliberate indifference by HRRJ officials in identifying and mitigating risks. Furthermore, HRRJ utilized prolonged restrictive housing which disparately affects incarcerated people with mental illnesses, thereby denying them access to activities and programming that they would otherwise be eligible for, and putting them at risk for serious harm. Officials at HRRJ knew of these substantial shortcomings and the associated risks and failed to take appropriate action.\n\nOn August 5, 2020, the DOJ filed this lawsuit against HRRJ in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia based on the findings in the December 2018 report and HRRJ\u2019s subsequent failure to take sufficient remedial steps. The DOJ alleges that HRRJ\u2019s policies and practices violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of people incarcerated in the facility. As a result, the DOJ asked Judge Rebecca Beach Smith to declare that HRRJ\u2019s practices violated the constitutional rights of incarcerated persons and violated the ADA, and to enjoin HRRJ to take immediate action to amend its policies and practices to ensure lawful conditions of confinement.\n\nBy the time that the complaint was filed, the parties had already negotiated a settlement. On the same day as the complaint was filed, the parties filed a joint settlement motion. In the settlement agreement, HRRJ agreed to implement a comprehensive list of reforms including appropriate screening and assessment for medical and mental health needs by qualified professionals, adequate treatment planning for medical and mental health concerns, suicide prevention practices, specialized mental health housing units, oversight of restrictive housing placement, increased medical and mental health staff, increased training for staff, increased collaboration between mental health staff and jail leadership, and a Quality Assurance program to identify and correct deficiencies with the medical and mental health care system to be overseen by a Quality Assurance Committee providing monthly reports to the monitor and the DOJ.\n\nThe settlement agreement noted that HRRJ would designate an Agreement Coordinator to coordinate compliance with the agreement. HRRJ agreed to create annual Implementation Plans to describe how it will fulfill its obligations under the agreement, including deadlines within the first year by which HRRJ must draft or revise policies and procedures, complete a staffing plan, develop and deliver training to HRRJ staff, develop and implement a Quality Improvement Committee, and develop and implement monthly quality assurance mechanisms to report on data relevant to prevent to prevent or minimize harm to incarcerated persons.\n\nA key provision of the settlement agreement was the mandatory appointment of an independent third-party monitor, to oversee HRRJ\u2019s compliance with the agreement. The monitor was agreed to be retained for a period of three years and provide biannual status reports to the DOJ, HRRJ and the court. The monitor would also undertake compliance reviews, on-site inspections and issue monitor reports every six months to assess compliance and HRRJ\u2019s progress on the various reform efforts. The reports will also be filed with the court. In the event of noncompliance with the agreement, the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia retained jurisdiction to enforce the agreement at the request of the DOJ.\n\nOn August 31, 2020, the court approved the settlement agreement and subsequently, on September 10, 2020, the court approved the appointment of James Conrad Welch to be the third-party monitor. The settlement agreement was effective as of August 31, 2020.\n\nBy the terms of the agreement, HRRJ was to implement all provisions of the agreement within four years and the agreement would terminate in five years, so long as HRRJ attained substantial compliance with the agreement and maintained that compliance for at least one year. HRRJ had the burden to prove that it has achieved and maintained substantial compliance with the agreement and has been operating in accordance with the requirements of the ADA and the U.S. Constitution continuously for one year. After the closure of the facility on April 1, 2024, and the filing of the final monitor\u2019s report on June 4, 2024, the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss the agreement on July 31, 2024. The court dismissed the agreement on the same day, and the case is now closed.",

    "target": "After a two-year investigation initiated in December 2016 under CRIPA and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a Notice on December 19, 2018 concluding that the Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority (\u201cHRRJ\u201d) failed to provide constitutionally adequate medical and mental health care to incarcerated peoples and placed people with serious mental illness in restrictive housing for prolonged periods of time. The DOJ also concluded that HRRJ\u2019s housing practices discriminate against incarcerated people with mental health disabilities in violation of the ADA.\n\nIn the Notice, the DOJ set forth factual findings about the conditions at HRRJ that violated incarcerated peoples\u2019 constitutional rights.

    "target": "After a two-year investigation initiated in December 2016 under CRIPA and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a Notice on December 19, 2018 concluding that the Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority (\u201cHRRJ\u201d) failed to provide constitutionally adequate medical and mental health care to incarcerated peoples and placed people with serious mental illness in restrictive housing for prolonged periods of time. The DOJ also concluded that HRRJ\u2019s housing practices discriminate against incarcerated people with mental health disabilities in violation of the ADA.\n\nIn the Notice, the DOJ set forth factual findings about the conditions at HRRJ that violated incarcerated peoples\u2019 constitutional rights. Principally, the DOJ found that medical and mental health care at HRRJ was constitutionally inadequate. In all stages of medical and mental health care (including patient intake, chronic care and emergency care, treatment and therapy, continuity of care, and security and care for suicidal persons), the quality of care and access to care was found to be severely deficient, subjecting patients to a serious risk of harm due to delays and lack of care. The DOJ also found a lack of oversight and accountability and a deliberate indifference by HRRJ officials in identifying and mitigating risks. Furthermore, HRRJ utilized prolonged restrictive housing which disparately affects incarcerated people with mental illnesses, thereby denying them access to activities and programming that they would otherwise be eligible for, and putting them at risk for serious harm. Officials at HRRJ knew of these substantial shortcomings and the associated risks and failed to take appropriate action.\n\nOn August 5, 2020, the DOJ filed this lawsuit against HRRJ in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia based on the findings in the December 2018 report and HRRJ\u2019s subsequent failure to take sufficient remedial steps. The DOJ alleges that HRRJ\u2019s policies and practices violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of people incarcerated in the facility. As a result, the DOJ asked Judge Rebecca Beach Smith to declare that HRRJ\u2019s practices violated the constitutional rights of incarcerated persons and violated the ADA, and to enjoin HRRJ to take immediate action to amend its policies and practices to ensure lawful conditions of confinement.\n\nBy the time that the complaint was filed, the parties had already negotiated a settlement. On the same day as the complaint was filed, the parties filed a joint settlement motion. In the settlement agreement, HRRJ agreed to implement a comprehensive list of reforms including appropriate screening and assessment for medical and mental health needs by qualified professionals, adequate treatment planning for medical and mental health concerns, suicide prevention practices, specialized mental health housing units, oversight of restrictive housing placement, increased medical and mental health staff, increased training for staff, increased collaboration between mental health staff and jail leadership, and a Quality Assurance program to identify and correct deficiencies with the medical and mental health care system to be overseen by a Quality Assurance Committee providing monthly reports to the monitor and the DOJ.\n\nThe settlement agreement noted that HRRJ would designate an Agreement Coordinator to coordinate compliance with the agreement. HRRJ agreed to create annual Implementation Plans to describe how it will fulfill its obligations under the agreement, including deadlines within the first year by which HRRJ must draft or revise policies and procedures, complete a staffing plan, develop and deliver training to HRRJ staff, develop and implement a Quality Improvement Committee, and develop and implement monthly quality assurance mechanisms to report on data relevant to prevent to prevent or minimize harm to incarcerated persons.\n\nA key provision of the settlement agreement was the mandatory appointment of an independent third-party monitor, to oversee HRRJ\u2019s compliance with the agreement. The monitor was agreed to be retained for a period of three years and provide biannual status reports to the DOJ, HRRJ and the court. The monitor would also undertake compliance reviews, on-site inspections and issue monitor reports every six months to assess compliance and HRRJ\u2019s progress on the various reform efforts. The reports will also be filed with the court. In the event of noncompliance with the agreement, the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia retained jurisdiction to enforce the agreement at the request of the DOJ.\n\nOn August 31, 2020, the court approved the settlement agreement and subsequently, on September 10, 2020, the court approved the appointment of James Conrad Welch to be the third-party monitor. The settlement agreement was effective as of August 31, 2020.\n\nBy the terms of the agreement, HRRJ was to implement all provisions of the agreement within four years and the agreement would terminate in five years, so long as HRRJ attained substantial compliance with the agreement and maintained that compliance for at least one year. HRRJ had the burden to prove that it has achieved and maintained substantial compliance with the agreement and has been operating in accordance with the requirements of the ADA and the U.S. Constitution continuously for one year. After the closure of the facility on April 1, 2024, and the filing of the final monitor\u2019s report on June 4, 2024, the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss the agreement on July 31, 2024. The court dismissed the agreement on the same day, and the case is now closed.",
