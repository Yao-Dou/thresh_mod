    "target": "This case challenged the Trump Administration\u2019s actions to limit the Social Security Administration\u2019s ability to serve people with disabilities under the guise of bureaucratic \u201cefficiency.\u201d On April 2, 2025, plaintiffs\u2014American Association of People with Disabilities, National Federation of the Blind, DEAF Equality, National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, Massachusetts Senior Action Council, and private individuals\u2014filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Judge Amit Priyavadan Mehta was assigned to the case. Plaintiffs sued the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Elon Musk, and other acting heads of these administrative agencies. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt widespread service disruptions and the elimination of legally required civil rights protections.\n\nPlaintiffs claimed that defendants\u2019 abrupt dismantling of SSA\u2019s operations caused irreparable harm to millions of disabled and elderly beneficiaries. They alleged that between January and March 2025, defendants orchestrated a sweeping rollback of services: eliminating the Office of Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity (OCREO), terminating the Office of Transformation, cutting 7,000 SSA employees, freezing hiring, and closing field offices. These changes, they argued, were ordered or heavily influenced by DOGE, a new federal entity created by Executive Order No. 14158, 90 Fed. Reg. 8441 (Jan. 29, 2025).\n\nExecutive Order 14158 established DOGE to \"modernize federal technology and software\" and to \"maximize governmental efficiency.\" It embedded DOGE teams within federal agencies and granted them sweeping access to internal operations and data. Plaintiffs argued that DOGE\u2019s directives had resulted in massive breakdowns in SSA\u2019s ability to deliver benefits, such as multi-hour phone hold times, crashed websites, inaccessible field offices, and termination of benefits for vulnerable individuals.\n\nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on April 2, 2025, alleging defendants\u2019 actions violated the Rehabilitation Act for discriminatory removal of accommodations and civil rights protections. They also asserted APA violations for arbitrary and capricious restructuring without statutory authority and not in accordance with law. Additionally, plaintiffs asserted a First Amendment challenge, arguing that defendants' dissolution of OCREO\u2014the SSA grievance system\u2014unconstitutionally deprived them of their right to petition for redress. Finally, they argued that defendants violated the Take Care and Due Process clauses. Plaintiffs sought a preliminary and permanent injunction barring further implementation of the DOGE-imposed reforms, restoration of OCREO and the Office of Transformation, reinstatement of staffing and telephone services, and court monitoring of SSA compliance. They also requested that the court declare the defendants\u2019 actions unlawful and unconstitutional.\n\nOn the same day, plaintiffs filed a separate motion for a preliminary injunction to stop the elimination of OCREA and the Office of Transformation within SSA, the revocation of the SSA offices, and the mass termination of SSA employees, and to roll back recent policies that increase applicants\u2019 and beneficiaries\u2019 need to seek services in person. Defendants filed their opposition to the preliminary injunction motion on April 16, arguing that (1) plaintiffs lacked standing, (2) the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction, and (3) their claims would fail on the merits. Plaintiffs responded on April 21, 2025, refuting all of defendants' arguments.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, an unopposed motion for leave to file an amicus brief in support of plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction was filed by the Center for Medicare Advocacy and Medicare Rights. In their brief, amici argued that disruption to the SSA system had negative effects on Medicare recipients, which disproportionately impacted disabled individuals. On April 15, amici---the States of Connecticut, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia by state of Connecticut---also filed a brief in support of plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nOn May 6, 2025, the court denied the motion for preliminary injunction, determining plaintiffs failed to establish irreparable harm. The court found that individual plaintiffs could not demonstrate \"life [or] death\" circumstances, and that plaintiff organizations could not prove in sufficient detail that they or their members were \"perceptibly impaired\" by defendants' actions.\n\nThe court has set a briefing schedule. Defendants will file their motion to dismiss by August 8, 2025. Plaintiffs' response brief in opposition to that motion will be due September 12, and defendants' reply will be due September 26. The court will rule on the motion to dismiss after that date.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

Judge Amit Priyavadan Mehta was assigned to the case. Plaintiffs sued the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Elon Musk, and other acting heads of these administrative agencies. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt widespread service disruptions and the elimination of legally required civil rights protections.\n\nPlaintiffs claimed that defendants\u2019 abrupt dismantling of SSA\u2019s operations caused irreparable harm to millions of disabled and elderly beneficiaries. They alleged that between January and March 2025, defendants orchestrated a sweeping rollback of services: eliminating the Office of Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity (OCREO), terminating the Office of Transformation, cutting 7,000 SSA employees, freezing hiring, and closing field offices. These changes, they argued, were ordered or heavily influenced by DOGE, a new federal entity created by Executive Order No. 14158, 90 Fed. Reg. 8441 (Jan. 29, 2025).\n\nExecutive Order 14158 established DOGE to \"modernize federal technology and software\" and to \"maximize governmental efficiency.\" It embedded DOGE teams within federal agencies and granted them sweeping access to internal operations and data. Plaintiffs argued that DOGE\u2019s directives had resulted in massive breakdowns in SSA\u2019s ability to deliver benefits, such as multi-hour phone hold times, crashed websites, inaccessible field offices, and termination of benefits for vulnerable individuals.\n\nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on April 2, 2025, alleging defendants\u2019 actions violated the Rehabilitation Act for discriminatory removal of accommodations and civil rights protections. They also asserted APA violations for arbitrary and capricious restructuring without statutory authority and not in accordance with law. Additionally, plaintiffs asserted a First Amendment challenge, arguing that defendants' dissolution of OCREO\u2014the SSA grievance system\u2014unconstitutionally deprived them of their right to petition for redress. Finally, they argued that defendants violated the Take Care and Due Process clauses. Plaintiffs sought a preliminary and permanent injunction barring further implementation of the DOGE-imposed reforms, restoration of OCREO and the Office of Transformation, reinstatement of staffing and telephone services, and court monitoring of SSA compliance. They also requested that the court declare the defendants\u2019 actions unlawful and unconstitutional.\n\nOn the same day, plaintiffs filed a separate motion for a preliminary injunction to stop the elimination of OCREA and the Office of Transformation within SSA, the revocation of the SSA offices, and the mass termination of SSA employees, and to roll back recent policies that increase applicants\u2019 and beneficiaries\u2019 need to seek services in person. Defendants filed their opposition to the preliminary injunction motion on April 16, arguing that (1) plaintiffs lacked standing, (2) the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction, and (3) their claims would fail on the merits. Plaintiffs responded on April 21, 2025, refuting all of defendants' arguments.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, an unopposed motion for leave to file an amicus brief in support of plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction was filed by the Center for Medicare Advocacy and Medicare Rights. In their brief, amici argued that disruption to the SSA system had negative effects on Medicare recipients, which disproportionately impacted disabled individuals. On April 15, amici---the States of Connecticut, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia by state of Connecticut---also filed a brief in support of plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nOn May 6, 2025, the court denied the motion for preliminary injunction, determining plaintiffs failed to establish irreparable harm. The court found that individual plaintiffs could not demonstrate \"life [or] death\" circumstances, and that plaintiff organizations could not prove in sufficient detail that they or their members were \"perceptibly impaired\" by defendants' actions.\n\nThe court has set a briefing schedule.

They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt widespread service disruptions and the elimination of legally required civil rights protections.\n\nPlaintiffs claimed that defendants\u2019 abrupt dismantling of SSA\u2019s operations caused irreparable harm to millions of disabled and elderly beneficiaries. They alleged that between January and March 2025, defendants orchestrated a sweeping rollback of services: eliminating the Office of Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity (OCREO), terminating the Office of Transformation, cutting 7,000 SSA employees, freezing hiring, and closing field offices. These changes, they argued, were ordered or heavily influenced by DOGE, a new federal entity created by Executive Order No. 14158, 90 Fed. Reg. 8441 (Jan. 29, 2025).\n\nExecutive Order 14158 established DOGE to \"modernize federal technology and software\" and to \"maximize governmental efficiency.\" It embedded DOGE teams within federal agencies and granted them sweeping access to internal operations and data. Plaintiffs argued that DOGE\u2019s directives had resulted in massive breakdowns in SSA\u2019s ability to deliver benefits, such as multi-hour phone hold times, crashed websites, inaccessible field offices, and termination of benefits for vulnerable individuals.\n\nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on April 2, 2025, alleging defendants\u2019 actions violated the Rehabilitation Act for discriminatory removal of accommodations and civil rights protections. They also asserted APA violations for arbitrary and capricious restructuring without statutory authority and not in accordance with law. Additionally, plaintiffs asserted a First Amendment challenge, arguing that defendants' dissolution of OCREO\u2014the SSA grievance system\u2014unconstitutionally deprived them of their right to petition for redress. Finally, they argued that defendants violated the Take Care and Due Process clauses. Plaintiffs sought a preliminary and permanent injunction barring further implementation of the DOGE-imposed reforms, restoration of OCREO and the Office of Transformation, reinstatement of staffing and telephone services, and court monitoring of SSA compliance. They also requested that the court declare the defendants\u2019 actions unlawful and unconstitutional.\n\nOn the same day, plaintiffs filed a separate motion for a preliminary injunction to stop the elimination of OCREA and the Office of Transformation within SSA, the revocation of the SSA offices, and the mass termination of SSA employees, and to roll back recent policies that increase applicants\u2019 and beneficiaries\u2019 need to seek services in person. Defendants filed their opposition to the preliminary injunction motion on April 16, arguing that (1) plaintiffs lacked standing, (2) the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction, and (3) their claims would fail on the merits. Plaintiffs responded on April 21, 2025, refuting all of defendants' arguments.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, an unopposed motion for leave to file an amicus brief in support of plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction was filed by the Center for Medicare Advocacy and Medicare Rights. In their brief, amici argued that disruption to the SSA system had negative effects on Medicare recipients, which disproportionately impacted disabled individuals. On April 15, amici---the States of Connecticut, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia by state of Connecticut---also filed a brief in support of plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nOn May 6, 2025, the court denied the motion for preliminary injunction, determining plaintiffs failed to establish irreparable harm. The court found that individual plaintiffs could not demonstrate \"life [or] death\" circumstances, and that plaintiff organizations could not prove in sufficient detail that they or their members were \"perceptibly impaired\" by defendants' actions.\n\nThe court has set a briefing schedule. Defendants will file their motion to dismiss by August 8, 2025. Plaintiffs' response brief in opposition to that motion will be due September 12, and defendants' reply will be due September 26. The court will rule on the motion to dismiss after that date.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged the Trump Administration\u2019s actions to limit the Social Security Administration\u2019s ability to serve people with disabilities under the guise of bureaucratic \u201cefficiency.\u201d On April 2, 2025, plaintiffs\u2014American Association of People with Disabilities, National Federation of the Blind, DEAF Equality, National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, Massachusetts Senior Action Council, and private individuals\u2014filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Judge Amit Priyavadan Mehta was assigned to the case. Plaintiffs sued the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Elon Musk, and other acting heads of these administrative agencies. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt widespread service disruptions and the elimination of legally required civil rights protections.\n\nPlaintiffs claimed that defendants\u2019 abrupt dismantling of SSA\u2019s operations caused irreparable harm to millions of disabled and elderly beneficiaries. They alleged that between January and March 2025, defendants orchestrated a sweeping rollback of services: eliminating the Office of Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity (OCREO), terminating the Office of Transformation, cutting 7,000 SSA employees, freezing hiring, and closing field offices. These changes, they argued, were ordered or heavily influenced by DOGE, a new federal entity created by Executive Order No. 14158, 90 Fed. Reg. 8441 (Jan. 29, 2025).\n\nExecutive Order 14158 established DOGE to \"modernize federal technology and software\" and to \"maximize governmental efficiency.\" It embedded DOGE teams within federal agencies and granted them sweeping access to internal operations and data. Plaintiffs argued that DOGE\u2019s directives had resulted in massive breakdowns in SSA\u2019s ability to deliver benefits, such as multi-hour phone hold times, crashed websites, inaccessible field offices, and termination of benefits for vulnerable individuals.\n\nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on April 2, 2025, alleging defendants\u2019 actions violated the Rehabilitation Act for discriminatory removal of accommodations and civil rights protections. They also asserted APA violations for arbitrary and capricious restructuring without statutory authority and not in accordance with law. Additionally, plaintiffs asserted a First Amendment challenge, arguing that defendants' dissolution of OCREO\u2014the SSA grievance system\u2014unconstitutionally deprived them of their right to petition for redress. Finally, they argued that defendants violated the Take Care and Due Process clauses. Plaintiffs sought a preliminary and permanent injunction barring further implementation of the DOGE-imposed reforms, restoration of OCREO and the Office of Transformation, reinstatement of staffing and telephone services, and court monitoring of SSA compliance. They also requested that the court declare the defendants\u2019 actions unlawful and unconstitutional.\n\nOn the same day, plaintiffs filed a separate motion for a preliminary injunction to stop the elimination of OCREA and the Office of Transformation within SSA, the revocation of the SSA offices, and the mass termination of SSA employees, and to roll back recent policies that increase applicants\u2019 and beneficiaries\u2019 need to seek services in person. Defendants filed their opposition to the preliminary injunction motion on April 16, arguing that (1) plaintiffs lacked standing, (2) the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction, and (3) their claims would fail on the merits. Plaintiffs responded on April 21, 2025, refuting all of defendants' arguments.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, an unopposed motion for leave to file an amicus brief in support of plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction was filed by the Center for Medicare Advocacy and Medicare Rights. In their brief, amici argued that disruption to the SSA system had negative effects on Medicare recipients, which disproportionately impacted disabled individuals. On April 15, amici---the States of Connecticut, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia by state of Connecticut---also filed a brief in support of plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nOn May 6, 2025, the court denied the motion for preliminary injunction, determining plaintiffs failed to establish irreparable harm. The court found that individual plaintiffs could not demonstrate \"life [or] death\" circumstances, and that plaintiff organizations could not prove in sufficient detail that they or their members were \"perceptibly impaired\" by defendants' actions.\n\nThe court has set a briefing schedule. Defendants will file their motion to dismiss by August 8, 2025. Plaintiffs' response brief in opposition to that motion will be due September 12, and defendants' reply will be due September 26. The court will rule on the motion to dismiss after that date.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",
