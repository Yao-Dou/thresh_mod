    "target": "This class action lawsuit challenges conditions at a temporary immigration detention facility known as \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d in the Florida Everglades. Built in June 2025, the facility consists of tents, trailers, chain-link fencing, and barbed wire, with a capacity of at least 3,000 people. It is surrounded by wetlands populated with alligators and venomous snakes. President Trump publicly stated that detainees would \u201clearn how to run away from an alligator if they escape prison,\u201d adding that \u201cthe only way out, really, is deportation.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs are immigrants detained at \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d along with several organizations, including Florida Keys Immigration, the Law Offices of Catherine Perez PLLC, Sanctuary of the South, and U.S. Immigration Law Counsel. On July 16, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, they sued the Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary, the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), ICE\u2019s Miami Field Office Director, the Governor of Florida, the Director of Miami-Dade Corrections and Rehabilitation, the Florida Division of Emergency Management and its Executive Director, and the Executive Office for Immigration Review and its Acting Director. The case was assigned to District Judge Rodolfo A. Ruiz II.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on July 17, 2025, seeking to include \u201call persons who are currently, or in the future, held at the Alligator Alcatraz detention facility.\u201d That same day, they also filed an expedited motion for a temporary restraining order to ensure access to counsel and the ability to file court documents by July 21, 2025, and a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the defendants restricted confidential attorney-client communication, violating detainees\u2019 First Amendment rights to legal counsel and Fifth Amendment due process rights. They claimed the facility lacked standard protocols for private communication, such as in-person visits or unmonitored calls, leaving detainees dependent on infrequent, monitored five-minute collect calls. Attorneys reported that ICE\u2019s detainee locator failed to show client locations, contact emails were invalid, phone calls were disconnected, and legal access was blocked at an armed checkpoint. Even when \u201cLegal Counsel Visitation Request Forms\u201d were provided, they often led to cancellations or no response. The plaintiffs also alleged that the government gave no guidance on which immigration courts handled bond motions, preventing detainees from contesting their detention.\n\nOn July 23, 2025, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 expedited motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction as an emergency motion, ruling it was not properly certified under Local Rule 7.1(d)(1). The court treated it instead as an expedited motion and stated it would not be considered until all defendants were served and expedited briefing was ordered. Plaintiffs were directed to file a service status report by July 28, 2025. The judge also required clarification on whether the motion sought relief only for the named plaintiffs or for the entire proposed class.\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for a preliminary injunction and class certification. The renewed preliminary injunction motion clarified that relief was sought for both the main class (access to counsel) and a new \u201cbond subclass\u201d (access to immigration courts). Unlike the original filing, it was not framed as an emergency motion. The renewed motion also included more detailed allegations, such as attorneys being stopped at a military checkpoint and visitation request forms requiring pre-approval of legal documents. The renewed motion for class certification introduced a new subclass of detainees seeking bond, added several new plaintiffs, and expanded the background with claims that the facility, which opened in early July 2025, had extreme heat, flooding, mosquitoes, and inadequate shelter.\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the court issued an order dismissing, without prejudice, defendant Sherea Green, the Director of Miami-Dade Corrections and Rehabilitation.\n\nOn August 18, 2025, the court heard the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. Later that day, the court transferred the case to the Middle District of Florida (2:25-cv-00747), where the \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d facility is located, and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 Fifth Amendment claim against the EOIR as moot after the agency identified the Krome immigration court\u2019s jurisdiction. The court left the First Amendment access-to-counsel claims unresolved, but noted that venue for them was improper in the Southern District. The order also recorded the plaintiffs\u2019 voluntary dismissal of one defendant and criticized the shifting nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 filings and venue theories. The case was reassigned to Judge Sheri Chappell.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This class action lawsuit challenges conditions at a temporary immigration detention facility known as \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d in the Florida Everglades. Built in June 2025, the facility consists of tents, trailers, chain-link fencing, and barbed wire, with a capacity of at least 3,000 people. It is surrounded by wetlands populated with alligators and venomous snakes. President Trump publicly stated that detainees would \u201clearn how to run away from an alligator if they escape prison,\u201d adding that \u201cthe only way out, really, is deportation.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs are immigrants detained at \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d along with several organizations, including Florida Keys Immigration, the Law Offices of Catherine Perez PLLC, Sanctuary of the South, and U.S. Immigration Law Counsel. On July 16, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, they sued the Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary, the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), ICE\u2019s Miami Field Office Director, the Governor of Florida, the Director of Miami-Dade Corrections and Rehabilitation, the Florida Division of Emergency Management and its Executive Director, and the Executive Office for Immigration Review and its Acting Director. The case was assigned to District Judge Rodolfo A. Ruiz II.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on July 17, 2025, seeking to include \u201call persons who are currently, or in the future, held at the Alligator Alcatraz detention facility.\u201d That same day, they also filed an expedited motion for a temporary restraining order to ensure access to counsel and the ability to file court documents by July 21, 2025, and a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the defendants restricted confidential attorney-client communication, violating detainees\u2019 First Amendment rights to legal counsel and Fifth Amendment due process rights. They claimed the facility lacked standard protocols for private communication, such as in-person visits or unmonitored calls, leaving detainees dependent on infrequent, monitored five-minute collect calls. Attorneys reported that ICE\u2019s detainee locator failed to show client locations, contact emails were invalid, phone calls were disconnected, and legal access was blocked at an armed checkpoint. Even when \u201cLegal Counsel Visitation Request Forms\u201d were provided, they often led to cancellations or no response. The plaintiffs also alleged that the government gave no guidance on which immigration courts handled bond motions, preventing detainees from contesting their detention.\n\nOn July 23, 2025, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 expedited motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction as an emergency motion, ruling it was not properly certified under Local Rule 7.1(d)(1). The court treated it instead as an expedited motion and stated it would not be considered until all defendants were served and expedited briefing was ordered. Plaintiffs were directed to file a service status report by July 28, 2025. The judge also required clarification on whether the motion sought relief only for the named plaintiffs or for the entire proposed class.\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for a preliminary injunction and class certification. The renewed preliminary injunction motion clarified that relief was sought for both the main class (access to counsel) and a new \u201cbond subclass\u201d (access to immigration courts). Unlike the original filing, it was not framed as an emergency motion. The renewed motion also included more detailed allegations, such as attorneys being stopped at a military checkpoint and visitation request forms requiring pre-approval of legal documents. The renewed motion for class certification introduced a new subclass of detainees seeking bond, added several new plaintiffs, and expanded the background with claims that the facility, which opened in early July 2025, had extreme heat, flooding, mosquitoes, and inadequate shelter.\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the court issued an order dismissing, without prejudice, defendant Sherea Green, the Director of Miami-Dade Corrections and Rehabilitation.\n\nOn August 18, 2025, the court heard the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. Later that day, the court transferred the case to the Middle District of Florida (2:25-cv-00747), where the \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d facility is located, and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 Fifth Amendment claim against the EOIR as moot after the agency identified the Krome immigration court\u2019s jurisdiction. The court left the First Amendment access-to-counsel claims unresolved, but noted that venue for them was improper in the Southern District. The order also recorded the plaintiffs\u2019 voluntary dismissal of one defendant and criticized the shifting nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 filings and venue theories. The case was reassigned to Judge Sheri Chappell.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This class action lawsuit challenges conditions at a temporary immigration detention facility known as \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d in the Florida Everglades. Built in June 2025, the facility consists of tents, trailers, chain-link fencing, and barbed wire, with a capacity of at least 3,000 people. It is surrounded by wetlands populated with alligators and venomous snakes. President Trump publicly stated that detainees would \u201clearn how to run away from an alligator if they escape prison,\u201d adding that \u201cthe only way out, really, is deportation.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs are immigrants detained at \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d along with several organizations, including Florida Keys Immigration, the Law Offices of Catherine Perez PLLC, Sanctuary of the South, and U.S. Immigration Law Counsel. On July 16, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, they sued the Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary, the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), ICE\u2019s Miami Field Office Director, the Governor of Florida, the Director of Miami-Dade Corrections and Rehabilitation, the Florida Division of Emergency Management and its Executive Director, and the Executive Office for Immigration Review and its Acting Director. The case was assigned to District Judge Rodolfo A. Ruiz II.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on July 17, 2025, seeking to include \u201call persons who are currently, or in the future, held at the Alligator Alcatraz detention facility.\u201d That same day, they also filed an expedited motion for a temporary restraining order to ensure access to counsel and the ability to file court documents by July 21, 2025, and a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the defendants restricted confidential attorney-client communication, violating detainees\u2019 First Amendment rights to legal counsel and Fifth Amendment due process rights. They claimed the facility lacked standard protocols for private communication, such as in-person visits or unmonitored calls, leaving detainees dependent on infrequent, monitored five-minute collect calls. Attorneys reported that ICE\u2019s detainee locator failed to show client locations, contact emails were invalid, phone calls were disconnected, and legal access was blocked at an armed checkpoint. Even when \u201cLegal Counsel Visitation Request Forms\u201d were provided, they often led to cancellations or no response. The plaintiffs also alleged that the government gave no guidance on which immigration courts handled bond motions, preventing detainees from contesting their detention.\n\nOn July 23, 2025, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 expedited motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction as an emergency motion, ruling it was not properly certified under Local Rule 7.1(d)(1). The court treated it instead as an expedited motion and stated it would not be considered until all defendants were served and expedited briefing was ordered. Plaintiffs were directed to file a service status report by July 28, 2025. The judge also required clarification on whether the motion sought relief only for the named plaintiffs or for the entire proposed class.\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for a preliminary injunction and class certification. The renewed preliminary injunction motion clarified that relief was sought for both the main class (access to counsel) and a new \u201cbond subclass\u201d (access to immigration courts). Unlike the original filing, it was not framed as an emergency motion. The renewed motion also included more detailed allegations, such as attorneys being stopped at a military checkpoint and visitation request forms requiring pre-approval of legal documents. The renewed motion for class certification introduced a new subclass of detainees seeking bond, added several new plaintiffs, and expanded the background with claims that the facility, which opened in early July 2025, had extreme heat, flooding, mosquitoes, and inadequate shelter.\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the court issued an order dismissing, without prejudice, defendant Sherea Green, the Director of Miami-Dade Corrections and Rehabilitation.\n\nOn August 18, 2025, the court heard the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. Later that day, the court transferred the case to the Middle District of Florida (2:25-cv-00747), where the \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d facility is located, and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 Fifth Amendment claim against the EOIR as moot after the agency identified the Krome immigration court\u2019s jurisdiction. The court left the First Amendment access-to-counsel claims unresolved, but noted that venue for them was improper in the Southern District. The order also recorded the plaintiffs\u2019 voluntary dismissal of one defendant and criticized the shifting nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 filings and venue theories. The case was reassigned to Judge Sheri Chappell.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

Built in June 2025, the facility consists of tents, trailers, chain-link fencing, and barbed wire, with a capacity of at least 3,000 people. It is surrounded by wetlands populated with alligators and venomous snakes. President Trump publicly stated that detainees would \u201clearn how to run away from an alligator if they escape prison,\u201d adding that \u201cthe only way out, really, is deportation.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs are immigrants detained at \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d along with several organizations, including Florida Keys Immigration, the Law Offices of Catherine Perez PLLC, Sanctuary of the South, and U.S. Immigration Law Counsel. On July 16, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, they sued the Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary, the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), ICE\u2019s Miami Field Office Director, the Governor of Florida, the Director of Miami-Dade Corrections and Rehabilitation, the Florida Division of Emergency Management and its Executive Director, and the Executive Office for Immigration Review and its Acting Director. The case was assigned to District Judge Rodolfo A. Ruiz II.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on July 17, 2025, seeking to include \u201call persons who are currently, or in the future, held at the Alligator Alcatraz detention facility.\u201d That same day, they also filed an expedited motion for a temporary restraining order to ensure access to counsel and the ability to file court documents by July 21, 2025, and a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the defendants restricted confidential attorney-client communication, violating detainees\u2019 First Amendment rights to legal counsel and Fifth Amendment due process rights. They claimed the facility lacked standard protocols for private communication, such as in-person visits or unmonitored calls, leaving detainees dependent on infrequent, monitored five-minute collect calls. Attorneys reported that ICE\u2019s detainee locator failed to show client locations, contact emails were invalid, phone calls were disconnected, and legal access was blocked at an armed checkpoint. Even when \u201cLegal Counsel Visitation Request Forms\u201d were provided, they often led to cancellations or no response. The plaintiffs also alleged that the government gave no guidance on which immigration courts handled bond motions, preventing detainees from contesting their detention.\n\nOn July 23, 2025, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 expedited motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction as an emergency motion, ruling it was not properly certified under Local Rule 7.1(d)(1). The court treated it instead as an expedited motion and stated it would not be considered until all defendants were served and expedited briefing was ordered. Plaintiffs were directed to file a service status report by July 28, 2025. The judge also required clarification on whether the motion sought relief only for the named plaintiffs or for the entire proposed class.\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for a preliminary injunction and class certification. The renewed preliminary injunction motion clarified that relief was sought for both the main class (access to counsel) and a new \u201cbond subclass\u201d (access to immigration courts). Unlike the original filing, it was not framed as an emergency motion.
