    "target": "This case challenged multiple actions taken by the Department of Labor (DOL) to shut down the Job Corps. The Job Corps trains and educates disadvantaged young people with additional career and technical instruction in order to assist them in attaining and retaining employment. Through career technical programs, career counseling, and apprenticeship programs, the Job Corps currently serves around 25,000 students.\n\nOn June 3, 2025, the plaintiffs, including national trade organizations and unions, companies with contracts with DOL relating to the Job Corps, Job Corps training center operators, and one current Job Corps student, filed suit in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs challenged multiple actions taken by the DOL that the plaintiffs allege were intended to shut down the Job Corps, such as halting background checks as required for new students, canceling pending or outstanding Job Corps procurements, terminating the provision of internet services, drastically reducing DOL's budget for Job Corps, and canceling contracts with Job Corps center operators. The notices of contract cancellation directed the centers to send students home and to begin the shutdown of the centers.\n\nRepresented by private and in-house general counsel, the plaintiffs alleged that the DOL's actions exceeded its statutory authority, were contrary to law, and were arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, and also that they were ultra vires and a violation of the Constitution's separation of powers. The plaintiffs asked the court to declare the defendants' actions unlawful, to enjoin the defendants from taking any steps to eliminate the Job Corps program, and to award the plaintiffs their court costs.\n\nThe plaintiffs also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on June 3. The case was assigned to District Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr., who granted the plaintiffs' motion on June 4. The court enjoined the defendants from giving effect to the elimination of the Job Corps program, or from taking any further actions to eliminate the program without Congressional authorization. The court also set a hearing for June 17 on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. After the hearing, the court extended the TRO until June 25 and ordered the parties to file a status report on June 20.\n\nThe court granted a preliminary injunction on June 25. The court found that at least some of the plaintiffs had standing and that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the suit. Turning to the merits, the court found that the defendants' actions effectively closed, rather than terminated, the centers. Because the defendants had attempted to close the centers, the court held that they were required by statute to meet certain procedural requirements, which were not met here. Therefore, the court announced that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the defendants had acted to contrary to law. As to the scope of the injunction, the court ruled that the injunction would be nationwide, but \"will not supersede any contrary ruling by the court in the District of Columbia or any other federal circuit or district courts outside of the Second Circuit.\" Finally, the court rejected the defendants' request to immediately stay its ruling pending appeal since the request was not fully briefed at the time of its ruling.\n\nOn June 27, the court ordered the parties to file letters discussing how, if at all, the Supreme Court's decision in\u00a0Casa Inc. v. Trump, which held that that universal injunctions \"likely exceed the authority conferred [on District Courts] by the Judiciary Act,\" impacted the injunction issued by the court in this case. The plaintiffs filed their letter on June 30, arguing that Casa should have no effect in this case since (1) the injunction here was based on the APA, which was not addressed in the Supreme Court's decision; and (2) the injunction here was not overbroad since \"setting aside Defendants\u2019 decision to eliminate Job Corps is necessary to accord complete relief to the plaintiffs in this case.\" The defendants filed their letter on July 11, arguing that \"this Court\u2019s injunction is impermissibly overbroad because it extends beyond the plaintiffs to preclude the government from acting with respect to non-parties.\" The defendants also claimed that the injunction was not entered under the APA; instead, the court \"granted a preliminary injunction under its traditional equitable authority, an authority that CASA made clear is limited to providing relief to the parties themselves.\"\n\nOn July 11 and July 17, two pro se individuals, students who were either attending or planning to attend Job Corps Centers, moved to intervene in the case.\n\nAfter hearing oral argument on July 23, the court amended the preliminary injunction on July 24. The court ruled that the injunction applied \"to the 31 centers covered by the Operator Plaintiffs and the 5 additional centers at which Plaintiff Transportation Communications Union/IAM provides training services.\" The court enjoined the defendants \"from enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to the closure of the private Job Corps centers, including the stop work orders and termination and non-renewal notices delivered to Job Corps center operators starting May 29, 2025, from issuing, enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to any shutdown tasks, job terminations, or student removals; and from taking any further action to close any Job Corps Centers.\" The court ordered the parties to file a schedule on how to proceed in the case on August 1.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged multiple actions taken by the Department of Labor (DOL) to shut down the Job Corps. The Job Corps trains and educates disadvantaged young people with additional career and technical instruction in order to assist them in attaining and retaining employment. Through career technical programs, career counseling, and apprenticeship programs, the Job Corps currently serves around 25,000 students.\n\nOn June 3, 2025, the plaintiffs, including national trade organizations and unions, companies with contracts with DOL relating to the Job Corps, Job Corps training center operators, and one current Job Corps student, filed suit in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs challenged multiple actions taken by the DOL that the plaintiffs allege were intended to shut down the Job Corps, such as halting background checks as required for new students, canceling pending or outstanding Job Corps procurements, terminating the provision of internet services, drastically reducing DOL's budget for Job Corps, and canceling contracts with Job Corps center operators. The notices of contract cancellation directed the centers to send students home and to begin the shutdown of the centers.\n\nRepresented by private and in-house general counsel, the plaintiffs alleged that the DOL's actions exceeded its statutory authority, were contrary to law, and were arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, and also that they were ultra vires and a violation of the Constitution's separation of powers. The plaintiffs asked the court to declare the defendants' actions unlawful, to enjoin the defendants from taking any steps to eliminate the Job Corps program, and to award the plaintiffs their court costs.\n\nThe plaintiffs also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on June 3. The case was assigned to District Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr., who granted the plaintiffs' motion on June 4. The court enjoined the defendants from giving effect to the elimination of the Job Corps program, or from taking any further actions to eliminate the program without Congressional authorization. The court also set a hearing for June 17 on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. After the hearing, the court extended the TRO until June 25 and ordered the parties to file a status report on June 20.\n\nThe court granted a preliminary injunction on June 25. The court found that at least some of the plaintiffs had standing and that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the suit. Turning to the merits, the court found that the defendants' actions effectively closed, rather than terminated, the centers. Because the defendants had attempted to close the centers, the court held that they were required by statute to meet certain procedural requirements, which were not met here. Therefore, the court announced that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the defendants had acted to contrary to law. As to the scope of the injunction, the court ruled that the injunction would be nationwide, but \"will not supersede any contrary ruling by the court in the District of Columbia or any other federal circuit or district courts outside of the Second Circuit.\" Finally, the court rejected the defendants' request to immediately stay its ruling pending appeal since the request was not fully briefed at the time of its ruling.\n\nOn June 27, the court ordered the parties to file letters discussing how, if at all, the Supreme Court's decision in\u00a0Casa Inc. v. Trump, which held that that universal injunctions \"likely exceed the authority conferred [on District Courts] by the Judiciary Act,\" impacted the injunction issued by the court in this case. The plaintiffs filed their letter on June 30, arguing that Casa should have no effect in this case since (1) the injunction here was based on the APA, which was not addressed in the Supreme Court's decision; and (2) the injunction here was not overbroad since \"setting aside Defendants\u2019 decision to eliminate Job Corps is necessary to accord complete relief to the plaintiffs in this case.\" The defendants filed their letter on July 11, arguing that \"this Court\u2019s injunction is impermissibly overbroad because it extends beyond the plaintiffs to preclude the government from acting with respect to non-parties.\" The defendants also claimed that the injunction was not entered under the APA; instead, the court \"granted a preliminary injunction under its traditional equitable authority, an authority that CASA made clear is limited to providing relief to the parties themselves.\"\n\nOn July 11 and July 17, two pro se individuals, students who were either attending or planning to attend Job Corps Centers, moved to intervene in the case.\n\nAfter hearing oral argument on July 23, the court amended the preliminary injunction on July 24. The court ruled that the injunction applied \"to the 31 centers covered by the Operator Plaintiffs and the 5 additional centers at which Plaintiff Transportation Communications Union/IAM provides training services.\" The court enjoined the defendants \"from enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to the closure of the private Job Corps centers, including the stop work orders and termination and non-renewal notices delivered to Job Corps center operators starting May 29, 2025, from issuing, enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to any shutdown tasks, job terminations, or student removals; and from taking any further action to close any Job Corps Centers.\" The court ordered the parties to file a schedule on how to proceed in the case on August 1.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged multiple actions taken by the Department of Labor (DOL) to shut down the Job Corps. The Job Corps trains and educates disadvantaged young people with additional career and technical instruction in order to assist them in attaining and retaining employment. Through career technical programs, career counseling, and apprenticeship programs, the Job Corps currently serves around 25,000 students.\n\nOn June 3, 2025, the plaintiffs, including national trade organizations and unions, companies with contracts with DOL relating to the Job Corps, Job Corps training center operators, and one current Job Corps student, filed suit in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs challenged multiple actions taken by the DOL that the plaintiffs allege were intended to shut down the Job Corps, such as halting background checks as required for new students, canceling pending or outstanding Job Corps procurements, terminating the provision of internet services, drastically reducing DOL's budget for Job Corps, and canceling contracts with Job Corps center operators. The notices of contract cancellation directed the centers to send students home and to begin the shutdown of the centers.\n\nRepresented by private and in-house general counsel, the plaintiffs alleged that the DOL's actions exceeded its statutory authority, were contrary to law, and were arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, and also that they were ultra vires and a violation of the Constitution's separation of powers. The plaintiffs asked the court to declare the defendants' actions unlawful, to enjoin the defendants from taking any steps to eliminate the Job Corps program, and to award the plaintiffs their court costs.\n\nThe plaintiffs also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on June 3. The case was assigned to District Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr., who granted the plaintiffs' motion on June 4. The court enjoined the defendants from giving effect to the elimination of the Job Corps program, or from taking any further actions to eliminate the program without Congressional authorization. The court also set a hearing for June 17 on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. After the hearing, the court extended the TRO until June 25 and ordered the parties to file a status report on June 20.\n\nThe court granted a preliminary injunction on June 25. The court found that at least some of the plaintiffs had standing and that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the suit. Turning to the merits, the court found that the defendants' actions effectively closed, rather than terminated, the centers. Because the defendants had attempted to close the centers, the court held that they were required by statute to meet certain procedural requirements, which were not met here. Therefore, the court announced that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the defendants had acted to contrary to law. As to the scope of the injunction, the court ruled that the injunction would be nationwide, but \"will not supersede any contrary ruling by the court in the District of Columbia or any other federal circuit or district courts outside of the Second Circuit.\" Finally, the court rejected the defendants' request to immediately stay its ruling pending appeal since the request was not fully briefed at the time of its ruling.\n\nOn June 27, the court ordered the parties to file letters discussing how, if at all, the Supreme Court's decision in\u00a0Casa Inc. v. Trump, which held that that universal injunctions \"likely exceed the authority conferred [on District Courts] by the Judiciary Act,\" impacted the injunction issued by the court in this case. The plaintiffs filed their letter on June 30, arguing that Casa should have no effect in this case since (1) the injunction here was based on the APA, which was not addressed in the Supreme Court's decision; and (2) the injunction here was not overbroad since \"setting aside Defendants\u2019 decision to eliminate Job Corps is necessary to accord complete relief to the plaintiffs in this case.\" The defendants filed their letter on July 11, arguing that \"this Court\u2019s injunction is impermissibly overbroad because it extends beyond the plaintiffs to preclude the government from acting with respect to non-parties.\" The defendants also claimed that the injunction was not entered under the APA; instead, the court \"granted a preliminary injunction under its traditional equitable authority, an authority that CASA made clear is limited to providing relief to the parties themselves.\"\n\nOn July 11 and July 17, two pro se individuals, students who were either attending or planning to attend Job Corps Centers, moved to intervene in the case.\n\nAfter hearing oral argument on July 23, the court amended the preliminary injunction on July 24. The court ruled that the injunction applied \"to the 31 centers covered by the Operator Plaintiffs and the 5 additional centers at which Plaintiff Transportation Communications Union/IAM provides training services.\" The court enjoined the defendants \"from enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to the closure of the private Job Corps centers, including the stop work orders and termination and non-renewal notices delivered to Job Corps center operators starting May 29, 2025, from issuing, enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to any shutdown tasks, job terminations, or student removals; and from taking any further action to close any Job Corps Centers.\" The court ordered the parties to file a schedule on how to proceed in the case on August 1.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged multiple actions taken by the Department of Labor (DOL) to shut down the Job Corps. The Job Corps trains and educates disadvantaged young people with additional career and technical instruction in order to assist them in attaining and retaining employment. Through career technical programs, career counseling, and apprenticeship programs, the Job Corps currently serves around 25,000 students.\n\nOn June 3, 2025, the plaintiffs, including national trade organizations and unions, companies with contracts with DOL relating to the Job Corps, Job Corps training center operators, and one current Job Corps student, filed suit in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs challenged multiple actions taken by the DOL that the plaintiffs allege were intended to shut down the Job Corps, such as halting background checks as required for new students, canceling pending or outstanding Job Corps procurements, terminating the provision of internet services, drastically reducing DOL's budget for Job Corps, and canceling contracts with Job Corps center operators. The notices of contract cancellation directed the centers to send students home and to begin the shutdown of the centers.\n\nRepresented by private and in-house general counsel, the plaintiffs alleged that the DOL's actions exceeded its statutory authority, were contrary to law, and were arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, and also that they were ultra vires and a violation of the Constitution's separation of powers. The plaintiffs asked the court to declare the defendants' actions unlawful, to enjoin the defendants from taking any steps to eliminate the Job Corps program, and to award the plaintiffs their court costs.\n\nThe plaintiffs also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on June 3. The case was assigned to District Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr., who granted the plaintiffs' motion on June 4. The court enjoined the defendants from giving effect to the elimination of the Job Corps program, or from taking any further actions to eliminate the program without Congressional authorization. The court also set a hearing for June 17 on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. After the hearing, the court extended the TRO until June 25 and ordered the parties to file a status report on June 20.\n\nThe court granted a preliminary injunction on June 25. The court found that at least some of the plaintiffs had standing and that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the suit. Turning to the merits, the court found that the defendants' actions effectively closed, rather than terminated, the centers. Because the defendants had attempted to close the centers, the court held that they were required by statute to meet certain procedural requirements, which were not met here. Therefore, the court announced that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the defendants had acted to contrary to law. As to the scope of the injunction, the court ruled that the injunction would be nationwide, but \"will not supersede any contrary ruling by the court in the District of Columbia or any other federal circuit or district courts outside of the Second Circuit.\" Finally, the court rejected the defendants' request to immediately stay its ruling pending appeal since the request was not fully briefed at the time of its ruling.\n\nOn June 27, the court ordered the parties to file letters discussing how, if at all, the Supreme Court's decision in\u00a0Casa Inc. v. Trump, which held that that universal injunctions \"likely exceed the authority conferred [on District Courts] by the Judiciary Act,\" impacted the injunction issued by the court in this case. The plaintiffs filed their letter on June 30, arguing that Casa should have no effect in this case since (1) the injunction here was based on the APA, which was not addressed in the Supreme Court's decision; and (2) the injunction here was not overbroad since \"setting aside Defendants\u2019 decision to eliminate Job Corps is necessary to accord complete relief to the plaintiffs in this case.\" The defendants filed their letter on July 11, arguing that \"this Court\u2019s injunction is impermissibly overbroad because it extends beyond the plaintiffs to preclude the government from acting with respect to non-parties.\" The defendants also claimed that the injunction was not entered under the APA; instead, the court \"granted a preliminary injunction under its traditional equitable authority, an authority that CASA made clear is limited to providing relief to the parties themselves.\"\n\nOn July 11 and July 17, two pro se individuals, students who were either attending or planning to attend Job Corps Centers, moved to intervene in the case.\n\nAfter hearing oral argument on July 23, the court amended the preliminary injunction on July 24. The court ruled that the injunction applied \"to the 31 centers covered by the Operator Plaintiffs and the 5 additional centers at which Plaintiff Transportation Communications Union/IAM provides training services.\" The court enjoined the defendants \"from enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to the closure of the private Job Corps centers, including the stop work orders and termination and non-renewal notices delivered to Job Corps center operators starting May 29, 2025, from issuing, enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to any shutdown tasks, job terminations, or student removals; and from taking any further action to close any Job Corps Centers.\" The court ordered the parties to file a schedule on how to proceed in the case on August 1.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",
