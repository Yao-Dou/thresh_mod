    "target": "This is a case about healthcare and isolation practices at Wisconsin prisons. On October 26, 2023, inmates at Wisconsin prisons brought a class action suit, filed in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Wisconsin, against the Wisconsin Department of Corrections and certain named prison officials in their official capacities. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. In their complaint, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations included that: (1) As a result of defendants\u2019 longstanding practices, there were severe delays in the provision of or complete denial of medical services when inmates seek or clearly require medical, dental, and/or mental health/psychological services. (2) Defendants implemented an unexplained seven-month lockdown at the Waupun Correctional Institution, during which medical delays continued or were exacerbated. (3) Defendants failed to provide minimally adequate living conditions to inmates in the lockdown period. (4) Defendants maintained a policy of isolating prisoners and providing inadequate environmental stimuli or nutrition in isolation, creating a substantial risk of physical and psychiatric harm. Plaintiffs alleged these practices and policies fall short of minimum constitutional guarantees, violating inmates\u2019 Eighth Amendment rights.\n\nOn November 20, 2023, Magistrate Judge William E. Duffin issued a screening order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 demand for compensatory and punitive damages from defendants, while preserving plaintiffs\u2019 plea of injunctive relief. The court reasoned that a suit against the state against state officials in their official capacity (as opposed to in their personal capacity), like a suit against an arm of the state such as the Department of Corrections, constitutes a suit against the state itself. As the state is immune from actions for damages under the Eleventh Amendment, the court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 demands for compensatory and punitive damages. Plaintiffs were allowed to continue to pursue injunctive relief.\n\nPlaintiffs thereafter filed an amended complaint on November 21, 2023, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the Department of Corrections and named officials, in their individual as well as official capacities. On March 22, 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction, arguing that the practices at the Wisconsin prison demonstrated a deliberate indifference to plaintiffs\u2019 well-being and civil rights.\n\nDefendants subsequently filed a motion for partial summary judgment, alleging that plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before they filed their complaint.\n\nOn March 28, 2024, plaintiffs filed a class certification motion, seeking to certify all previous, current, and future inmates in Wisconsin correctional facilities subject to their health practices (medical, mental health, and dental care), or subject to isolation.\n\nOn May 23, 2024, Judge Duffin issued a decision and order granting defendants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment. Recognizing that federal law requires plaintiffs situated like the plaintiffs here must exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit, the court found that only two complaints relating to dental and eye care made by two of the named plaintiffs exhausted all administrative remedies. The court found all other plaintiffs failed to exhaust their claims prior to filing suit. As such, the court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 mental health and isolation-related claims, and the relevant named plaintiffs whose interest in the case related only to those claims.\n\nOn June 4, 2024, Judge Duffin further issued a decision and order denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for preliminary injunction and for class certification. With respect to the motion for preliminary injunction, the court determined that after defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion had been granted, only two named plaintiffs remained, each with a single discrete claim, and the plaintiffs\u2019 motion did not address those specific claims and therefore was not entitled to a preliminary injunction. With respect to the motion to certify the suit as a class action, the court found class certification improper as plaintiffs did not specify a specific policy at issue nor specify a time period during which the policies at issue were in place.\n\nFollowing the court\u2019s ruling, on August 6, 2024, plaintiffs moved and stipulated to dismiss the case without prejudice. As of that date, the case was dismissed without prejudice to all parties.",

    "target": "This is a case about healthcare and isolation practices at Wisconsin prisons. On October 26, 2023, inmates at Wisconsin prisons brought a class action suit, filed in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Wisconsin, against the Wisconsin Department of Corrections and certain named prison officials in their official capacities. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. In their complaint, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations included that: (1) As a result of defendants\u2019 longstanding practices, there were severe delays in the provision of or complete denial of medical services when inmates seek or clearly require medical, dental, and/or mental health/psychological services. (2) Defendants implemented an unexplained seven-month lockdown at the Waupun Correctional Institution, during which medical delays continued or were exacerbated. (3) Defendants failed to provide minimally adequate living conditions to inmates in the lockdown period. (4) Defendants maintained a policy of isolating prisoners and providing inadequate environmental stimuli or nutrition in isolation, creating a substantial risk of physical and psychiatric harm. Plaintiffs alleged these practices and policies fall short of minimum constitutional guarantees, violating inmates\u2019 Eighth Amendment rights.\n\nOn November 20, 2023, Magistrate Judge William E. Duffin issued a screening order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 demand for compensatory and punitive damages from defendants, while preserving plaintiffs\u2019 plea of injunctive relief. The court reasoned that a suit against the state against state officials in their official capacity (as opposed to in their personal capacity), like a suit against an arm of the state such as the Department of Corrections, constitutes a suit against the state itself. As the state is immune from actions for damages under the Eleventh Amendment, the court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 demands for compensatory and punitive damages. Plaintiffs were allowed to continue to pursue injunctive relief.\n\nPlaintiffs thereafter filed an amended complaint on November 21, 2023, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the Department of Corrections and named officials, in their individual as well as official capacities. On March 22, 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction, arguing that the practices at the Wisconsin prison demonstrated a deliberate indifference to plaintiffs\u2019 well-being and civil rights.\n\nDefendants subsequently filed a motion for partial summary judgment, alleging that plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before they filed their complaint.\n\nOn March 28, 2024, plaintiffs filed a class certification motion, seeking to certify all previous, current, and future inmates in Wisconsin correctional facilities subject to their health practices (medical, mental health, and dental care), or subject to isolation.\n\nOn May 23, 2024, Judge Duffin issued a decision and order granting defendants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment. Recognizing that federal law requires plaintiffs situated like the plaintiffs here must exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit, the court found that only two complaints relating to dental and eye care made by two of the named plaintiffs exhausted all administrative remedies. The court found all other plaintiffs failed to exhaust their claims prior to filing suit. As such, the court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 mental health and isolation-related claims, and the relevant named plaintiffs whose interest in the case related only to those claims.\n\nOn June 4, 2024, Judge Duffin further issued a decision and order denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for preliminary injunction and for class certification. With respect to the motion for preliminary injunction, the court determined that after defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion had been granted, only two named plaintiffs remained, each with a single discrete claim, and the plaintiffs\u2019 motion did not address those specific claims and therefore was not entitled to a preliminary injunction. With respect to the motion to certify the suit as a class action, the court found class certification improper as plaintiffs did not specify a specific policy at issue nor specify a time period during which the policies at issue were in place.\n\nFollowing the court\u2019s ruling, on August 6, 2024, plaintiffs moved and stipulated to dismiss the case without prejudice. As of that date, the case was dismissed without prejudice to all parties.",

    "target": "This is a case about healthcare and isolation practices at Wisconsin prisons. On October 26, 2023, inmates at Wisconsin prisons brought a class action suit, filed in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Wisconsin, against the Wisconsin Department of Corrections and certain named prison officials in their official capacities. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. In their complaint, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations included that: (1) As a result of defendants\u2019 longstanding practices, there were severe delays in the provision of or complete denial of medical services when inmates seek or clearly require medical, dental, and/or mental health/psychological services. (2) Defendants implemented an unexplained seven-month lockdown at the Waupun Correctional Institution, during which medical delays continued or were exacerbated. (3) Defendants failed to provide minimally adequate living conditions to inmates in the lockdown period. (4) Defendants maintained a policy of isolating prisoners and providing inadequate environmental stimuli or nutrition in isolation, creating a substantial risk of physical and psychiatric harm. Plaintiffs alleged these practices and policies fall short of minimum constitutional guarantees, violating inmates\u2019 Eighth Amendment rights.\n\nOn November 20, 2023, Magistrate Judge William E. Duffin issued a screening order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 demand for compensatory and punitive damages from defendants, while preserving plaintiffs\u2019 plea of injunctive relief. The court reasoned that a suit against the state against state officials in their official capacity (as opposed to in their personal capacity), like a suit against an arm of the state such as the Department of Corrections, constitutes a suit against the state itself. As the state is immune from actions for damages under the Eleventh Amendment, the court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 demands for compensatory and punitive damages. Plaintiffs were allowed to continue to pursue injunctive relief.\n\nPlaintiffs thereafter filed an amended complaint on November 21, 2023, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the Department of Corrections and named officials, in their individual as well as official capacities. On March 22, 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction, arguing that the practices at the Wisconsin prison demonstrated a deliberate indifference to plaintiffs\u2019 well-being and civil rights.\n\nDefendants subsequently filed a motion for partial summary judgment, alleging that plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before they filed their complaint.\n\nOn March 28, 2024, plaintiffs filed a class certification motion, seeking to certify all previous, current, and future inmates in Wisconsin correctional facilities subject to their health practices (medical, mental health, and dental care), or subject to isolation.\n\nOn May 23, 2024, Judge Duffin issued a decision and order granting defendants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment. Recognizing that federal law requires plaintiffs situated like the plaintiffs here must exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit, the court found that only two complaints relating to dental and eye care made by two of the named plaintiffs exhausted all administrative remedies. The court found all other plaintiffs failed to exhaust their claims prior to filing suit. As such, the court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 mental health and isolation-related claims, and the relevant named plaintiffs whose interest in the case related only to those claims.\n\nOn June 4, 2024, Judge Duffin further issued a decision and order denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for preliminary injunction and for class certification. With respect to the motion for preliminary injunction, the court determined that after defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion had been granted, only two named plaintiffs remained, each with a single discrete claim, and the plaintiffs\u2019 motion did not address those specific claims and therefore was not entitled to a preliminary injunction. With respect to the motion to certify the suit as a class action, the court found class certification improper as plaintiffs did not specify a specific policy at issue nor specify a time period during which the policies at issue were in place.\n\nFollowing the court\u2019s ruling, on August 6, 2024, plaintiffs moved and stipulated to dismiss the case without prejudice. As of that date, the case was dismissed without prejudice to all parties.",
