    "target": "This case challenged the abrupt termination of numerous National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded research projects and the halting of grant application processes. On April 2, 2025, the American Public Health Association; IBIS Reproductive Health; International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW); and four private plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs, consisting of leading health research organizations and individual research scientists, sued the National Institutes of Health and the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiffs were represented by counsel from the Protect Democracy Project, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation. The case was initially assigned to Judge Murphy, but on May 1, 2025, he recused himself and the case was reassigned to Judge William G. Young.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from a series of government directives beginning in February 2025 aimed at terminating NIH-funded research on topics and populations the administration disfavored, including \u201cgender identity,\u201d \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u201d (DEI), \u201cvaccine hesitancy,\u201d and studies involving certain foreign entities. According to the complaint, these directives followed President Trump\u2019s January 2025 executive orders seeking to end equity-related programs and grants. The plaintiffs alleged that, in response, NIH issued guidance instructing staff to identify and terminate grants in these categories. This led to the abrupt termination of ongoing projects\u2014many years in progress with significant financial and time investments\u2014and the refusal to consider certain pending applications, including those aimed at diversifying researcher backgrounds. The plaintiffs argued that these terminations lacked scientifically valid reasons and disregarded established NIH protocols, which normally require non-compliance or cause to justify termination.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought seven claims, primarily under the Administrative Procedure Act , to challenge the defendants' actions, including the termination of grants, refusal to consider applications, and the issuance of new directives. The first three counts alleged that these actions were arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and exceeded statutory authority. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed the defendants failed to provide adequate reasoning, ignored their own policies, and improperly relied on external guidance that had not yet been formally adopted. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unreasonably delayed reviewing grant applications, and that the directives were unconstitutionally vague, violating the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. Finally, they asserted that the defendants violated the separation of powers by usurping Congress's legislative authority and ignoring statutory mandates.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory relief to have the court declare the defendants\u2019 actions unlawful and unconstitutional, along with temporary and permanent injunctions to prevent the enforcement of the directives, including further grant terminations and withholding of application reviews. They requested an order requiring NIH to restore the terminated grants retroactively and to review all properly submitted applications in accordance with existing NIH policies and strategic plans. Additionally, the plaintiffs sought regular status reports from the defendants confirming compliance with any court orders, an injunction protecting them from any retaliatory consequences for their involvement in the litigation, and an award of their reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a motion for a protective order. In the preliminary injunction motion, they sought the court\u2019s intervention to halt the ongoing disruption caused by the defendants\u2019 alleged unlawful and unconstitutional actions. In the protective order motion, the plaintiffs requested that the court safeguard the names and other identifying information of certain organizational declarants from unnecessary disclosure to the defendants and prevent their participation in the litigation from being used for any potentially retaliatory purposes.\n\nBetween April and June 2025, a wide range of academic institutions, professional associations, civil rights organizations, and attorneys general from 20 states and the District of Columbia filed a series of amicus briefs. These briefs collectively underscored the broad alarm within the scientific, academic, and public health communities regarding the sweeping implications of the challenged NIH policies. They emphasized the dangers of politicizing scientific grantmaking, warned against the erosion of established peer review protocols, and highlighted the discouraging effect on critical research related to marginalized populations, public health misinformation, and global health collaboration. Several amici also detailed the institutional and societal harms caused by abruptly halting ongoing projects\u2014pointing to disruptions to career trajectories, institutional partnerships, and public trust in federal research systems.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court held a status conference to clarify the procedural posture of the case, focusing on the defendants\u2019 earlier filings that raised jurisdictional and legal sufficiency challenges. During the conference, Judge Young and the parties discussed treating portions of the government\u2019s prior briefing as a de facto motion to dismiss. The judge noted that resolving these threshold legal issues early would help streamline the litigation. On May 28, 2025, Judge Young held a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs emphasized the immediate and irreversible harms resulting from the abrupt termination of their NIH-funded research, as well as the chilling effect on future scientific inquiry. The defendants responded that NIH had acted within its discretion in realigning grant priorities in accordance with updated government policy.\n\nThen, on May 30, 2025, Judge Young issued a Memorandum and Order formally resolving the construed motion to dismiss. 2025 WL 1548611. The court dismissed without prejudice Counts\u202fIV (vagueness under the APA), VI (vagueness under the Fifth Amendment), and VII (separation-of-powers claim), finding that they were either insufficiently pleaded or jurisdictionally improper. However, it denied dismissal as to the remaining claims\u2014Counts\u202fI\u2013III (arbitrary-and-capricious, failure-to-follow-law, statutory overreach) and Count\u202fV (unreasonable delay)\u2014allowing those claims to proceed. This order narrowed the litigation to the core equitable and statutory challenges related to grant reinstatement and procedural fairness, while preserving plaintiffs\u2019 ability to refile the dismissed constitutional claims at a later stage if appropriate.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, Judge Young issued a temporary order barring further grant terminations and granted the protective order in part, allowing limited redactions of declarant identities to prevent retaliation. That same day, he granted the preliminary injunction, concluding that NIH\u2019s termination of numerous grants was \u201carbitrary, unlawful, and discriminatory.\u201d The court ordered NIH to reinstate funding for affected grants and resume review of pending applications per established procedures\u2014emphasizing the unprecedented and unlawful nature of NIH\u2019s actions. The injunction took immediate effect.\n\nShortly after, on June 20, 2025, the defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss, arguing that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over certain claims, particularly those seeking monetary relief, which they contended must be brought in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. They also argued that some claims were nonjusticiable and that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue relief for future or speculative harms.\n\nThen, on June 23, 2025, Judge Young entered a partial final judgment, formally resolving the preliminary injunction and protective order rulings to permit immediate appellate review. 2025 WL 1747128. That same day, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the First Circuit and moved to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal. On June 24, Judge Young issued an order clarifying that the injunction remains in effect and that the June 23 partial final judgment only applied to the injunctive phase. 2025 WL 1745899.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss, asserting that their claims sought equitable relief, not monetary damages, and were properly within the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the court issued a supplemental judgment order, reaffirming that the earlier injunction would remain in force during the appeal and reiterating that the judgment covered only the resolved portion of the case. The next day, on July 3, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the district court\u2019s orders pending appeal, seeking expedited relief from the First Circuit to halt enforcement of the preliminary injunction. On July 4, 2025, the First Circuit denied the request for immediate relief and noted its intent to rule on the broader stay relief \"as soon as practicable\" after the completion of briefing.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the First Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal, holding that the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act to review the agency action and issue declaratory relief. The court found that the defendants had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on either their jurisdictional challenge or the merits. It also concluded that the balance of equities and the public interest favored the plaintiffs. The court declared the Directives void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated. Likewise, the resulting grant terminations were also declared void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated.\n\nFollowing the First Circuit\u2019s decision, the defendants submitted an application for a stay to the Supreme Court on July 24, 2025. They argued [https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/07/trump-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-pause-order-requiring-payment-of-grants/] that the district court lacked authority under federal law to compel the grant payments, citing a prior Supreme Court order permitting the Department of Education to suspend comparable funding. They also contended that the case belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court partially granted and partially denied the stay application. The court stayed the district court\u2019s judgments vacating the government\u2019s termination of research grants, reasoning that the court likely lacked jurisdiction over claims based on a contractual \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d which belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the government would face irreparable harm if funds were disbursed. However, the court denied the stay for judgments vacating the NIH guidance documents, finding that the government had failed to show irreparable harm from their vacatur. The decision was closely divided: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh favored granting the stay in full; the Chief Justice and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson favored denying it in full; and Justice Barrett concurred in the partial grant and partial denial.\n\nThe litigation remains ongoing on two tracks: continued merits proceedings in the district court, and an active appeal in the First Circuit concerning the merits of the case.",

Several amici also detailed the institutional and societal harms caused by abruptly halting ongoing projects\u2014pointing to disruptions to career trajectories, institutional partnerships, and public trust in federal research systems.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court held a status conference to clarify the procedural posture of the case, focusing on the defendants\u2019 earlier filings that raised jurisdictional and legal sufficiency challenges. During the conference, Judge Young and the parties discussed treating portions of the government\u2019s prior briefing as a de facto motion to dismiss. The judge noted that resolving these threshold legal issues early would help streamline the litigation. On May 28, 2025, Judge Young held a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs emphasized the immediate and irreversible harms resulting from the abrupt termination of their NIH-funded research, as well as the chilling effect on future scientific inquiry. The defendants responded that NIH had acted within its discretion in realigning grant priorities in accordance with updated government policy.\n\nThen, on May 30, 2025, Judge Young issued a Memorandum and Order formally resolving the construed motion to dismiss. 2025 WL 1548611. The court dismissed without prejudice Counts\u202fIV (vagueness under the APA), VI (vagueness under the Fifth Amendment), and VII (separation-of-powers claim), finding that they were either insufficiently pleaded or jurisdictionally improper. However, it denied dismissal as to the remaining claims\u2014Counts\u202fI\u2013III (arbitrary-and-capricious, failure-to-follow-law, statutory overreach) and Count\u202fV (unreasonable delay)\u2014allowing those claims to proceed. This order narrowed the litigation to the core equitable and statutory challenges related to grant reinstatement and procedural fairness, while preserving plaintiffs\u2019 ability to refile the dismissed constitutional claims at a later stage if appropriate.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, Judge Young issued a temporary order barring further grant terminations and granted the protective order in part, allowing limited redactions of declarant identities to prevent retaliation. That same day, he granted the preliminary injunction, concluding that NIH\u2019s termination of numerous grants was \u201carbitrary, unlawful, and discriminatory.\u201d The court ordered NIH to reinstate funding for affected grants and resume review of pending applications per established procedures\u2014emphasizing the unprecedented and unlawful nature of NIH\u2019s actions. The injunction took immediate effect.\n\nShortly after, on June 20, 2025, the defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss, arguing that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over certain claims, particularly those seeking monetary relief, which they contended must be brought in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. They also argued that some claims were nonjusticiable and that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue relief for future or speculative harms.\n\nThen, on June 23, 2025, Judge Young entered a partial final judgment, formally resolving the preliminary injunction and protective order rulings to permit immediate appellate review. 2025 WL 1747128. That same day, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the First Circuit and moved to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal. On June 24, Judge Young issued an order clarifying that the injunction remains in effect and that the June 23 partial final judgment only applied to the injunctive phase. 2025 WL 1745899.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss, asserting that their claims sought equitable relief, not monetary damages, and were properly within the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the court issued a supplemental judgment order, reaffirming that the earlier injunction would remain in force during the appeal and reiterating that the judgment covered only the resolved portion of the case. The next day, on July 3, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the district court\u2019s orders pending appeal, seeking expedited relief from the First Circuit to halt enforcement of the preliminary injunction. On July 4, 2025, the First Circuit denied the request for immediate relief and noted its intent to rule on the broader stay relief \"as soon as practicable\" after the completion of briefing.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the First Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal, holding that the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act to review the agency action and issue declaratory relief. The court found that the defendants had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on either their jurisdictional challenge or the merits. It also concluded that the balance of equities and the public interest favored the plaintiffs. The court declared the Directives void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated. Likewise, the resulting grant terminations were also declared void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated.\n\nFollowing the First Circuit\u2019s decision, the defendants submitted an application for a stay to the Supreme Court on July 24, 2025. They argued [https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/07/trump-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-pause-order-requiring-payment-of-grants/] that the district court lacked authority under federal law to compel the grant payments, citing a prior Supreme Court order permitting the Department of Education to suspend comparable funding. They also contended that the case belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court partially granted and partially denied the stay application. The court stayed the district court\u2019s judgments vacating the government\u2019s termination of research grants, reasoning that the court likely lacked jurisdiction over claims based on a contractual \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d which belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the government would face irreparable harm if funds were disbursed. However, the court denied the stay for judgments vacating the NIH guidance documents, finding that the government had failed to show irreparable harm from their vacatur. The decision was closely divided: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh favored granting the stay in full; the Chief Justice and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson favored denying it in full; and Justice Barrett concurred in the partial grant and partial denial.\n\nThe litigation remains ongoing on two tracks: continued merits proceedings in the district court, and an active appeal in the First Circuit concerning the merits of the case.",

    "target": "This case challenged the abrupt termination of numerous National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded research projects and the halting of grant application processes. On April 2, 2025, the American Public Health Association; IBIS Reproductive Health; International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW); and four private plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs, consisting of leading health research organizations and individual research scientists, sued the National Institutes of Health and the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiffs were represented by counsel from the Protect Democracy Project, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation. The case was initially assigned to Judge Murphy, but on May 1, 2025, he recused himself and the case was reassigned to Judge William G. Young.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from a series of government directives beginning in February 2025 aimed at terminating NIH-funded research on topics and populations the administration disfavored, including \u201cgender identity,\u201d \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u201d (DEI), \u201cvaccine hesitancy,\u201d and studies involving certain foreign entities. According to the complaint, these directives followed President Trump\u2019s January 2025 executive orders seeking to end equity-related programs and grants. The plaintiffs alleged that, in response, NIH issued guidance instructing staff to identify and terminate grants in these categories. This led to the abrupt termination of ongoing projects\u2014many years in progress with significant financial and time investments\u2014and the refusal to consider certain pending applications, including those aimed at diversifying researcher backgrounds. The plaintiffs argued that these terminations lacked scientifically valid reasons and disregarded established NIH protocols, which normally require non-compliance or cause to justify termination.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought seven claims, primarily under the Administrative Procedure Act , to challenge the defendants' actions, including the termination of grants, refusal to consider applications, and the issuance of new directives. The first three counts alleged that these actions were arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and exceeded statutory authority. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed the defendants failed to provide adequate reasoning, ignored their own policies, and improperly relied on external guidance that had not yet been formally adopted. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unreasonably delayed reviewing grant applications, and that the directives were unconstitutionally vague, violating the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. Finally, they asserted that the defendants violated the separation of powers by usurping Congress's legislative authority and ignoring statutory mandates.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory relief to have the court declare the defendants\u2019 actions unlawful and unconstitutional, along with temporary and permanent injunctions to prevent the enforcement of the directives, including further grant terminations and withholding of application reviews. They requested an order requiring NIH to restore the terminated grants retroactively and to review all properly submitted applications in accordance with existing NIH policies and strategic plans. Additionally, the plaintiffs sought regular status reports from the defendants confirming compliance with any court orders, an injunction protecting them from any retaliatory consequences for their involvement in the litigation, and an award of their reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a motion for a protective order. In the preliminary injunction motion, they sought the court\u2019s intervention to halt the ongoing disruption caused by the defendants\u2019 alleged unlawful and unconstitutional actions. In the protective order motion, the plaintiffs requested that the court safeguard the names and other identifying information of certain organizational declarants from unnecessary disclosure to the defendants and prevent their participation in the litigation from being used for any potentially retaliatory purposes.\n\nBetween April and June 2025, a wide range of academic institutions, professional associations, civil rights organizations, and attorneys general from 20 states and the District of Columbia filed a series of amicus briefs. These briefs collectively underscored the broad alarm within the scientific, academic, and public health communities regarding the sweeping implications of the challenged NIH policies. They emphasized the dangers of politicizing scientific grantmaking, warned against the erosion of established peer review protocols, and highlighted the discouraging effect on critical research related to marginalized populations, public health misinformation, and global health collaboration.

    "target": "This case challenged the abrupt termination of numerous National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded research projects and the halting of grant application processes. On April 2, 2025, the American Public Health Association; IBIS Reproductive Health; International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW); and four private plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs, consisting of leading health research organizations and individual research scientists, sued the National Institutes of Health and the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiffs were represented by counsel from the Protect Democracy Project, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation. The case was initially assigned to Judge Murphy, but on May 1, 2025, he recused himself and the case was reassigned to Judge William G. Young.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from a series of government directives beginning in February 2025 aimed at terminating NIH-funded research on topics and populations the administration disfavored, including \u201cgender identity,\u201d \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u201d (DEI), \u201cvaccine hesitancy,\u201d and studies involving certain foreign entities. According to the complaint, these directives followed President Trump\u2019s January 2025 executive orders seeking to end equity-related programs and grants. The plaintiffs alleged that, in response, NIH issued guidance instructing staff to identify and terminate grants in these categories. This led to the abrupt termination of ongoing projects\u2014many years in progress with significant financial and time investments\u2014and the refusal to consider certain pending applications, including those aimed at diversifying researcher backgrounds. The plaintiffs argued that these terminations lacked scientifically valid reasons and disregarded established NIH protocols, which normally require non-compliance or cause to justify termination.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought seven claims, primarily under the Administrative Procedure Act , to challenge the defendants' actions, including the termination of grants, refusal to consider applications, and the issuance of new directives. The first three counts alleged that these actions were arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and exceeded statutory authority. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed the defendants failed to provide adequate reasoning, ignored their own policies, and improperly relied on external guidance that had not yet been formally adopted. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unreasonably delayed reviewing grant applications, and that the directives were unconstitutionally vague, violating the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. Finally, they asserted that the defendants violated the separation of powers by usurping Congress's legislative authority and ignoring statutory mandates.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory relief to have the court declare the defendants\u2019 actions unlawful and unconstitutional, along with temporary and permanent injunctions to prevent the enforcement of the directives, including further grant terminations and withholding of application reviews. They requested an order requiring NIH to restore the terminated grants retroactively and to review all properly submitted applications in accordance with existing NIH policies and strategic plans. Additionally, the plaintiffs sought regular status reports from the defendants confirming compliance with any court orders, an injunction protecting them from any retaliatory consequences for their involvement in the litigation, and an award of their reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a motion for a protective order. In the preliminary injunction motion, they sought the court\u2019s intervention to halt the ongoing disruption caused by the defendants\u2019 alleged unlawful and unconstitutional actions. In the protective order motion, the plaintiffs requested that the court safeguard the names and other identifying information of certain organizational declarants from unnecessary disclosure to the defendants and prevent their participation in the litigation from being used for any potentially retaliatory purposes.\n\nBetween April and June 2025, a wide range of academic institutions, professional associations, civil rights organizations, and attorneys general from 20 states and the District of Columbia filed a series of amicus briefs. These briefs collectively underscored the broad alarm within the scientific, academic, and public health communities regarding the sweeping implications of the challenged NIH policies. They emphasized the dangers of politicizing scientific grantmaking, warned against the erosion of established peer review protocols, and highlighted the discouraging effect on critical research related to marginalized populations, public health misinformation, and global health collaboration. Several amici also detailed the institutional and societal harms caused by abruptly halting ongoing projects\u2014pointing to disruptions to career trajectories, institutional partnerships, and public trust in federal research systems.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court held a status conference to clarify the procedural posture of the case, focusing on the defendants\u2019 earlier filings that raised jurisdictional and legal sufficiency challenges. During the conference, Judge Young and the parties discussed treating portions of the government\u2019s prior briefing as a de facto motion to dismiss. The judge noted that resolving these threshold legal issues early would help streamline the litigation. On May 28, 2025, Judge Young held a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs emphasized the immediate and irreversible harms resulting from the abrupt termination of their NIH-funded research, as well as the chilling effect on future scientific inquiry. The defendants responded that NIH had acted within its discretion in realigning grant priorities in accordance with updated government policy.\n\nThen, on May 30, 2025, Judge Young issued a Memorandum and Order formally resolving the construed motion to dismiss. 2025 WL 1548611. The court dismissed without prejudice Counts\u202fIV (vagueness under the APA), VI (vagueness under the Fifth Amendment), and VII (separation-of-powers claim), finding that they were either insufficiently pleaded or jurisdictionally improper. However, it denied dismissal as to the remaining claims\u2014Counts\u202fI\u2013III (arbitrary-and-capricious, failure-to-follow-law, statutory overreach) and Count\u202fV (unreasonable delay)\u2014allowing those claims to proceed. This order narrowed the litigation to the core equitable and statutory challenges related to grant reinstatement and procedural fairness, while preserving plaintiffs\u2019 ability to refile the dismissed constitutional claims at a later stage if appropriate.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, Judge Young issued a temporary order barring further grant terminations and granted the protective order in part, allowing limited redactions of declarant identities to prevent retaliation. That same day, he granted the preliminary injunction, concluding that NIH\u2019s termination of numerous grants was \u201carbitrary, unlawful, and discriminatory.\u201d The court ordered NIH to reinstate funding for affected grants and resume review of pending applications per established procedures\u2014emphasizing the unprecedented and unlawful nature of NIH\u2019s actions. The injunction took immediate effect.\n\nShortly after, on June 20, 2025, the defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss, arguing that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over certain claims, particularly those seeking monetary relief, which they contended must be brought in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. They also argued that some claims were nonjusticiable and that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue relief for future or speculative harms.\n\nThen, on June 23, 2025, Judge Young entered a partial final judgment, formally resolving the preliminary injunction and protective order rulings to permit immediate appellate review. 2025 WL 1747128. That same day, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the First Circuit and moved to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal. On June 24, Judge Young issued an order clarifying that the injunction remains in effect and that the June 23 partial final judgment only applied to the injunctive phase. 2025 WL 1745899.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss, asserting that their claims sought equitable relief, not monetary damages, and were properly within the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the court issued a supplemental judgment order, reaffirming that the earlier injunction would remain in force during the appeal and reiterating that the judgment covered only the resolved portion of the case. The next day, on July 3, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the district court\u2019s orders pending appeal, seeking expedited relief from the First Circuit to halt enforcement of the preliminary injunction. On July 4, 2025, the First Circuit denied the request for immediate relief and noted its intent to rule on the broader stay relief \"as soon as practicable\" after the completion of briefing.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the First Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal, holding that the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act to review the agency action and issue declaratory relief. The court found that the defendants had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on either their jurisdictional challenge or the merits. It also concluded that the balance of equities and the public interest favored the plaintiffs. The court declared the Directives void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated. Likewise, the resulting grant terminations were also declared void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated.\n\nFollowing the First Circuit\u2019s decision, the defendants submitted an application for a stay to the Supreme Court on July 24, 2025. They argued [https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/07/trump-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-pause-order-requiring-payment-of-grants/] that the district court lacked authority under federal law to compel the grant payments, citing a prior Supreme Court order permitting the Department of Education to suspend comparable funding. They also contended that the case belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court partially granted and partially denied the stay application. The court stayed the district court\u2019s judgments vacating the government\u2019s termination of research grants, reasoning that the court likely lacked jurisdiction over claims based on a contractual \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d which belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the government would face irreparable harm if funds were disbursed. However, the court denied the stay for judgments vacating the NIH guidance documents, finding that the government had failed to show irreparable harm from their vacatur. The decision was closely divided: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh favored granting the stay in full; the Chief Justice and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson favored denying it in full; and Justice Barrett concurred in the partial grant and partial denial.\n\nThe litigation remains ongoing on two tracks: continued merits proceedings in the district court, and an active appeal in the First Circuit concerning the merits of the case.",

    "target": "This case challenged the abrupt termination of numerous National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded research projects and the halting of grant application processes. On April 2, 2025, the American Public Health Association; IBIS Reproductive Health; International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW); and four private plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs, consisting of leading health research organizations and individual research scientists, sued the National Institutes of Health and the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiffs were represented by counsel from the Protect Democracy Project, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation. The case was initially assigned to Judge Murphy, but on May 1, 2025, he recused himself and the case was reassigned to Judge William G. Young.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from a series of government directives beginning in February 2025 aimed at terminating NIH-funded research on topics and populations the administration disfavored, including \u201cgender identity,\u201d \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u201d (DEI), \u201cvaccine hesitancy,\u201d and studies involving certain foreign entities. According to the complaint, these directives followed President Trump\u2019s January 2025 executive orders seeking to end equity-related programs and grants. The plaintiffs alleged that, in response, NIH issued guidance instructing staff to identify and terminate grants in these categories. This led to the abrupt termination of ongoing projects\u2014many years in progress with significant financial and time investments\u2014and the refusal to consider certain pending applications, including those aimed at diversifying researcher backgrounds. The plaintiffs argued that these terminations lacked scientifically valid reasons and disregarded established NIH protocols, which normally require non-compliance or cause to justify termination.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought seven claims, primarily under the Administrative Procedure Act , to challenge the defendants' actions, including the termination of grants, refusal to consider applications, and the issuance of new directives. The first three counts alleged that these actions were arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and exceeded statutory authority. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed the defendants failed to provide adequate reasoning, ignored their own policies, and improperly relied on external guidance that had not yet been formally adopted. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unreasonably delayed reviewing grant applications, and that the directives were unconstitutionally vague, violating the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. Finally, they asserted that the defendants violated the separation of powers by usurping Congress's legislative authority and ignoring statutory mandates.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory relief to have the court declare the defendants\u2019 actions unlawful and unconstitutional, along with temporary and permanent injunctions to prevent the enforcement of the directives, including further grant terminations and withholding of application reviews. They requested an order requiring NIH to restore the terminated grants retroactively and to review all properly submitted applications in accordance with existing NIH policies and strategic plans. Additionally, the plaintiffs sought regular status reports from the defendants confirming compliance with any court orders, an injunction protecting them from any retaliatory consequences for their involvement in the litigation, and an award of their reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a motion for a protective order. In the preliminary injunction motion, they sought the court\u2019s intervention to halt the ongoing disruption caused by the defendants\u2019 alleged unlawful and unconstitutional actions. In the protective order motion, the plaintiffs requested that the court safeguard the names and other identifying information of certain organizational declarants from unnecessary disclosure to the defendants and prevent their participation in the litigation from being used for any potentially retaliatory purposes.\n\nBetween April and June 2025, a wide range of academic institutions, professional associations, civil rights organizations, and attorneys general from 20 states and the District of Columbia filed a series of amicus briefs. These briefs collectively underscored the broad alarm within the scientific, academic, and public health communities regarding the sweeping implications of the challenged NIH policies. They emphasized the dangers of politicizing scientific grantmaking, warned against the erosion of established peer review protocols, and highlighted the discouraging effect on critical research related to marginalized populations, public health misinformation, and global health collaboration. Several amici also detailed the institutional and societal harms caused by abruptly halting ongoing projects\u2014pointing to disruptions to career trajectories, institutional partnerships, and public trust in federal research systems.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court held a status conference to clarify the procedural posture of the case, focusing on the defendants\u2019 earlier filings that raised jurisdictional and legal sufficiency challenges. During the conference, Judge Young and the parties discussed treating portions of the government\u2019s prior briefing as a de facto motion to dismiss. The judge noted that resolving these threshold legal issues early would help streamline the litigation. On May 28, 2025, Judge Young held a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs emphasized the immediate and irreversible harms resulting from the abrupt termination of their NIH-funded research, as well as the chilling effect on future scientific inquiry. The defendants responded that NIH had acted within its discretion in realigning grant priorities in accordance with updated government policy.\n\nThen, on May 30, 2025, Judge Young issued a Memorandum and Order formally resolving the construed motion to dismiss. 2025 WL 1548611. The court dismissed without prejudice Counts\u202fIV (vagueness under the APA), VI (vagueness under the Fifth Amendment), and VII (separation-of-powers claim), finding that they were either insufficiently pleaded or jurisdictionally improper. However, it denied dismissal as to the remaining claims\u2014Counts\u202fI\u2013III (arbitrary-and-capricious, failure-to-follow-law, statutory overreach) and Count\u202fV (unreasonable delay)\u2014allowing those claims to proceed. This order narrowed the litigation to the core equitable and statutory challenges related to grant reinstatement and procedural fairness, while preserving plaintiffs\u2019 ability to refile the dismissed constitutional claims at a later stage if appropriate.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, Judge Young issued a temporary order barring further grant terminations and granted the protective order in part, allowing limited redactions of declarant identities to prevent retaliation. That same day, he granted the preliminary injunction, concluding that NIH\u2019s termination of numerous grants was \u201carbitrary, unlawful, and discriminatory.\u201d The court ordered NIH to reinstate funding for affected grants and resume review of pending applications per established procedures\u2014emphasizing the unprecedented and unlawful nature of NIH\u2019s actions. The injunction took immediate effect.\n\nShortly after, on June 20, 2025, the defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss, arguing that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over certain claims, particularly those seeking monetary relief, which they contended must be brought in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. They also argued that some claims were nonjusticiable and that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue relief for future or speculative harms.\n\nThen, on June 23, 2025, Judge Young entered a partial final judgment, formally resolving the preliminary injunction and protective order rulings to permit immediate appellate review. 2025 WL 1747128. That same day, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the First Circuit and moved to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal. On June 24, Judge Young issued an order clarifying that the injunction remains in effect and that the June 23 partial final judgment only applied to the injunctive phase. 2025 WL 1745899.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss, asserting that their claims sought equitable relief, not monetary damages, and were properly within the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the court issued a supplemental judgment order, reaffirming that the earlier injunction would remain in force during the appeal and reiterating that the judgment covered only the resolved portion of the case. The next day, on July 3, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the district court\u2019s orders pending appeal, seeking expedited relief from the First Circuit to halt enforcement of the preliminary injunction. On July 4, 2025, the First Circuit denied the request for immediate relief and noted its intent to rule on the broader stay relief \"as soon as practicable\" after the completion of briefing.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the First Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal, holding that the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act to review the agency action and issue declaratory relief. The court found that the defendants had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on either their jurisdictional challenge or the merits. It also concluded that the balance of equities and the public interest favored the plaintiffs. The court declared the Directives void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated. Likewise, the resulting grant terminations were also declared void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated.\n\nFollowing the First Circuit\u2019s decision, the defendants submitted an application for a stay to the Supreme Court on July 24, 2025. They argued [https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/07/trump-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-pause-order-requiring-payment-of-grants/] that the district court lacked authority under federal law to compel the grant payments, citing a prior Supreme Court order permitting the Department of Education to suspend comparable funding. They also contended that the case belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court partially granted and partially denied the stay application. The court stayed the district court\u2019s judgments vacating the government\u2019s termination of research grants, reasoning that the court likely lacked jurisdiction over claims based on a contractual \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d which belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the government would face irreparable harm if funds were disbursed. However, the court denied the stay for judgments vacating the NIH guidance documents, finding that the government had failed to show irreparable harm from their vacatur. The decision was closely divided: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh favored granting the stay in full; the Chief Justice and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson favored denying it in full; and Justice Barrett concurred in the partial grant and partial denial.\n\nThe litigation remains ongoing on two tracks: continued merits proceedings in the district court, and an active appeal in the First Circuit concerning the merits of the case.",

    "target": "This case challenged the abrupt termination of numerous National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded research projects and the halting of grant application processes. On April 2, 2025, the American Public Health Association; IBIS Reproductive Health; International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW); and four private plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs, consisting of leading health research organizations and individual research scientists, sued the National Institutes of Health and the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiffs were represented by counsel from the Protect Democracy Project, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation. The case was initially assigned to Judge Murphy, but on May 1, 2025, he recused himself and the case was reassigned to Judge William G. Young.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from a series of government directives beginning in February 2025 aimed at terminating NIH-funded research on topics and populations the administration disfavored, including \u201cgender identity,\u201d \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u201d (DEI), \u201cvaccine hesitancy,\u201d and studies involving certain foreign entities. According to the complaint, these directives followed President Trump\u2019s January 2025 executive orders seeking to end equity-related programs and grants. The plaintiffs alleged that, in response, NIH issued guidance instructing staff to identify and terminate grants in these categories. This led to the abrupt termination of ongoing projects\u2014many years in progress with significant financial and time investments\u2014and the refusal to consider certain pending applications, including those aimed at diversifying researcher backgrounds. The plaintiffs argued that these terminations lacked scientifically valid reasons and disregarded established NIH protocols, which normally require non-compliance or cause to justify termination.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought seven claims, primarily under the Administrative Procedure Act , to challenge the defendants' actions, including the termination of grants, refusal to consider applications, and the issuance of new directives. The first three counts alleged that these actions were arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and exceeded statutory authority. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed the defendants failed to provide adequate reasoning, ignored their own policies, and improperly relied on external guidance that had not yet been formally adopted. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unreasonably delayed reviewing grant applications, and that the directives were unconstitutionally vague, violating the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. Finally, they asserted that the defendants violated the separation of powers by usurping Congress's legislative authority and ignoring statutory mandates.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory relief to have the court declare the defendants\u2019 actions unlawful and unconstitutional, along with temporary and permanent injunctions to prevent the enforcement of the directives, including further grant terminations and withholding of application reviews. They requested an order requiring NIH to restore the terminated grants retroactively and to review all properly submitted applications in accordance with existing NIH policies and strategic plans. Additionally, the plaintiffs sought regular status reports from the defendants confirming compliance with any court orders, an injunction protecting them from any retaliatory consequences for their involvement in the litigation, and an award of their reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a motion for a protective order. In the preliminary injunction motion, they sought the court\u2019s intervention to halt the ongoing disruption caused by the defendants\u2019 alleged unlawful and unconstitutional actions. In the protective order motion, the plaintiffs requested that the court safeguard the names and other identifying information of certain organizational declarants from unnecessary disclosure to the defendants and prevent their participation in the litigation from being used for any potentially retaliatory purposes.\n\nBetween April and June 2025, a wide range of academic institutions, professional associations, civil rights organizations, and attorneys general from 20 states and the District of Columbia filed a series of amicus briefs. These briefs collectively underscored the broad alarm within the scientific, academic, and public health communities regarding the sweeping implications of the challenged NIH policies. They emphasized the dangers of politicizing scientific grantmaking, warned against the erosion of established peer review protocols, and highlighted the discouraging effect on critical research related to marginalized populations, public health misinformation, and global health collaboration. Several amici also detailed the institutional and societal harms caused by abruptly halting ongoing projects\u2014pointing to disruptions to career trajectories, institutional partnerships, and public trust in federal research systems.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court held a status conference to clarify the procedural posture of the case, focusing on the defendants\u2019 earlier filings that raised jurisdictional and legal sufficiency challenges. During the conference, Judge Young and the parties discussed treating portions of the government\u2019s prior briefing as a de facto motion to dismiss. The judge noted that resolving these threshold legal issues early would help streamline the litigation. On May 28, 2025, Judge Young held a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs emphasized the immediate and irreversible harms resulting from the abrupt termination of their NIH-funded research, as well as the chilling effect on future scientific inquiry. The defendants responded that NIH had acted within its discretion in realigning grant priorities in accordance with updated government policy.\n\nThen, on May 30, 2025, Judge Young issued a Memorandum and Order formally resolving the construed motion to dismiss. 2025 WL 1548611. The court dismissed without prejudice Counts\u202fIV (vagueness under the APA), VI (vagueness under the Fifth Amendment), and VII (separation-of-powers claim), finding that they were either insufficiently pleaded or jurisdictionally improper. However, it denied dismissal as to the remaining claims\u2014Counts\u202fI\u2013III (arbitrary-and-capricious, failure-to-follow-law, statutory overreach) and Count\u202fV (unreasonable delay)\u2014allowing those claims to proceed. This order narrowed the litigation to the core equitable and statutory challenges related to grant reinstatement and procedural fairness, while preserving plaintiffs\u2019 ability to refile the dismissed constitutional claims at a later stage if appropriate.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, Judge Young issued a temporary order barring further grant terminations and granted the protective order in part, allowing limited redactions of declarant identities to prevent retaliation. That same day, he granted the preliminary injunction, concluding that NIH\u2019s termination of numerous grants was \u201carbitrary, unlawful, and discriminatory.\u201d The court ordered NIH to reinstate funding for affected grants and resume review of pending applications per established procedures\u2014emphasizing the unprecedented and unlawful nature of NIH\u2019s actions. The injunction took immediate effect.\n\nShortly after, on June 20, 2025, the defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss, arguing that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over certain claims, particularly those seeking monetary relief, which they contended must be brought in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. They also argued that some claims were nonjusticiable and that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue relief for future or speculative harms.\n\nThen, on June 23, 2025, Judge Young entered a partial final judgment, formally resolving the preliminary injunction and protective order rulings to permit immediate appellate review. 2025 WL 1747128. That same day, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the First Circuit and moved to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal. On June 24, Judge Young issued an order clarifying that the injunction remains in effect and that the June 23 partial final judgment only applied to the injunctive phase. 2025 WL 1745899.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss, asserting that their claims sought equitable relief, not monetary damages, and were properly within the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the court issued a supplemental judgment order, reaffirming that the earlier injunction would remain in force during the appeal and reiterating that the judgment covered only the resolved portion of the case. The next day, on July 3, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the district court\u2019s orders pending appeal, seeking expedited relief from the First Circuit to halt enforcement of the preliminary injunction. On July 4, 2025, the First Circuit denied the request for immediate relief and noted its intent to rule on the broader stay relief \"as soon as practicable\" after the completion of briefing.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the First Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal, holding that the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act to review the agency action and issue declaratory relief. The court found that the defendants had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on either their jurisdictional challenge or the merits. It also concluded that the balance of equities and the public interest favored the plaintiffs. The court declared the Directives void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated. Likewise, the resulting grant terminations were also declared void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated.\n\nFollowing the First Circuit\u2019s decision, the defendants submitted an application for a stay to the Supreme Court on July 24, 2025. They argued [https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/07/trump-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-pause-order-requiring-payment-of-grants/] that the district court lacked authority under federal law to compel the grant payments, citing a prior Supreme Court order permitting the Department of Education to suspend comparable funding. They also contended that the case belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court partially granted and partially denied the stay application. The court stayed the district court\u2019s judgments vacating the government\u2019s termination of research grants, reasoning that the court likely lacked jurisdiction over claims based on a contractual \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d which belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the government would face irreparable harm if funds were disbursed. However, the court denied the stay for judgments vacating the NIH guidance documents, finding that the government had failed to show irreparable harm from their vacatur. The decision was closely divided: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh favored granting the stay in full; the Chief Justice and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson favored denying it in full; and Justice Barrett concurred in the partial grant and partial denial.\n\nThe litigation remains ongoing on two tracks: continued merits proceedings in the district court, and an active appeal in the First Circuit concerning the merits of the case.",

    "target": "This case challenged the abrupt termination of numerous National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded research projects and the halting of grant application processes. On April 2, 2025, the American Public Health Association; IBIS Reproductive Health; International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW); and four private plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs, consisting of leading health research organizations and individual research scientists, sued the National Institutes of Health and the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiffs were represented by counsel from the Protect Democracy Project, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation. The case was initially assigned to Judge Murphy, but on May 1, 2025, he recused himself and the case was reassigned to Judge William G. Young.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from a series of government directives beginning in February 2025 aimed at terminating NIH-funded research on topics and populations the administration disfavored, including \u201cgender identity,\u201d \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u201d (DEI), \u201cvaccine hesitancy,\u201d and studies involving certain foreign entities. According to the complaint, these directives followed President Trump\u2019s January 2025 executive orders seeking to end equity-related programs and grants. The plaintiffs alleged that, in response, NIH issued guidance instructing staff to identify and terminate grants in these categories. This led to the abrupt termination of ongoing projects\u2014many years in progress with significant financial and time investments\u2014and the refusal to consider certain pending applications, including those aimed at diversifying researcher backgrounds. The plaintiffs argued that these terminations lacked scientifically valid reasons and disregarded established NIH protocols, which normally require non-compliance or cause to justify termination.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought seven claims, primarily under the Administrative Procedure Act , to challenge the defendants' actions, including the termination of grants, refusal to consider applications, and the issuance of new directives. The first three counts alleged that these actions were arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and exceeded statutory authority. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed the defendants failed to provide adequate reasoning, ignored their own policies, and improperly relied on external guidance that had not yet been formally adopted. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unreasonably delayed reviewing grant applications, and that the directives were unconstitutionally vague, violating the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. Finally, they asserted that the defendants violated the separation of powers by usurping Congress's legislative authority and ignoring statutory mandates.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory relief to have the court declare the defendants\u2019 actions unlawful and unconstitutional, along with temporary and permanent injunctions to prevent the enforcement of the directives, including further grant terminations and withholding of application reviews. They requested an order requiring NIH to restore the terminated grants retroactively and to review all properly submitted applications in accordance with existing NIH policies and strategic plans. Additionally, the plaintiffs sought regular status reports from the defendants confirming compliance with any court orders, an injunction protecting them from any retaliatory consequences for their involvement in the litigation, and an award of their reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a motion for a protective order. In the preliminary injunction motion, they sought the court\u2019s intervention to halt the ongoing disruption caused by the defendants\u2019 alleged unlawful and unconstitutional actions. In the protective order motion, the plaintiffs requested that the court safeguard the names and other identifying information of certain organizational declarants from unnecessary disclosure to the defendants and prevent their participation in the litigation from being used for any potentially retaliatory purposes.\n\nBetween April and June 2025, a wide range of academic institutions, professional associations, civil rights organizations, and attorneys general from 20 states and the District of Columbia filed a series of amicus briefs. These briefs collectively underscored the broad alarm within the scientific, academic, and public health communities regarding the sweeping implications of the challenged NIH policies. They emphasized the dangers of politicizing scientific grantmaking, warned against the erosion of established peer review protocols, and highlighted the discouraging effect on critical research related to marginalized populations, public health misinformation, and global health collaboration. Several amici also detailed the institutional and societal harms caused by abruptly halting ongoing projects\u2014pointing to disruptions to career trajectories, institutional partnerships, and public trust in federal research systems.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court held a status conference to clarify the procedural posture of the case, focusing on the defendants\u2019 earlier filings that raised jurisdictional and legal sufficiency challenges. During the conference, Judge Young and the parties discussed treating portions of the government\u2019s prior briefing as a de facto motion to dismiss. The judge noted that resolving these threshold legal issues early would help streamline the litigation. On May 28, 2025, Judge Young held a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs emphasized the immediate and irreversible harms resulting from the abrupt termination of their NIH-funded research, as well as the chilling effect on future scientific inquiry. The defendants responded that NIH had acted within its discretion in realigning grant priorities in accordance with updated government policy.\n\nThen, on May 30, 2025, Judge Young issued a Memorandum and Order formally resolving the construed motion to dismiss. 2025 WL 1548611. The court dismissed without prejudice Counts\u202fIV (vagueness under the APA), VI (vagueness under the Fifth Amendment), and VII (separation-of-powers claim), finding that they were either insufficiently pleaded or jurisdictionally improper. However, it denied dismissal as to the remaining claims\u2014Counts\u202fI\u2013III (arbitrary-and-capricious, failure-to-follow-law, statutory overreach) and Count\u202fV (unreasonable delay)\u2014allowing those claims to proceed. This order narrowed the litigation to the core equitable and statutory challenges related to grant reinstatement and procedural fairness, while preserving plaintiffs\u2019 ability to refile the dismissed constitutional claims at a later stage if appropriate.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, Judge Young issued a temporary order barring further grant terminations and granted the protective order in part, allowing limited redactions of declarant identities to prevent retaliation. That same day, he granted the preliminary injunction, concluding that NIH\u2019s termination of numerous grants was \u201carbitrary, unlawful, and discriminatory.\u201d The court ordered NIH to reinstate funding for affected grants and resume review of pending applications per established procedures\u2014emphasizing the unprecedented and unlawful nature of NIH\u2019s actions. The injunction took immediate effect.\n\nShortly after, on June 20, 2025, the defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss, arguing that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over certain claims, particularly those seeking monetary relief, which they contended must be brought in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. They also argued that some claims were nonjusticiable and that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue relief for future or speculative harms.\n\nThen, on June 23, 2025, Judge Young entered a partial final judgment, formally resolving the preliminary injunction and protective order rulings to permit immediate appellate review. 2025 WL 1747128. That same day, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the First Circuit and moved to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal. On June 24, Judge Young issued an order clarifying that the injunction remains in effect and that the June 23 partial final judgment only applied to the injunctive phase. 2025 WL 1745899.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss, asserting that their claims sought equitable relief, not monetary damages, and were properly within the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the court issued a supplemental judgment order, reaffirming that the earlier injunction would remain in force during the appeal and reiterating that the judgment covered only the resolved portion of the case. The next day, on July 3, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the district court\u2019s orders pending appeal, seeking expedited relief from the First Circuit to halt enforcement of the preliminary injunction. On July 4, 2025, the First Circuit denied the request for immediate relief and noted its intent to rule on the broader stay relief \"as soon as practicable\" after the completion of briefing.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the First Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal, holding that the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act to review the agency action and issue declaratory relief. The court found that the defendants had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on either their jurisdictional challenge or the merits. It also concluded that the balance of equities and the public interest favored the plaintiffs. The court declared the Directives void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated. Likewise, the resulting grant terminations were also declared void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated.\n\nFollowing the First Circuit\u2019s decision, the defendants submitted an application for a stay to the Supreme Court on July 24, 2025. They argued [https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/07/trump-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-pause-order-requiring-payment-of-grants/] that the district court lacked authority under federal law to compel the grant payments, citing a prior Supreme Court order permitting the Department of Education to suspend comparable funding. They also contended that the case belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court partially granted and partially denied the stay application. The court stayed the district court\u2019s judgments vacating the government\u2019s termination of research grants, reasoning that the court likely lacked jurisdiction over claims based on a contractual \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d which belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the government would face irreparable harm if funds were disbursed. However, the court denied the stay for judgments vacating the NIH guidance documents, finding that the government had failed to show irreparable harm from their vacatur. The decision was closely divided: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh favored granting the stay in full; the Chief Justice and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson favored denying it in full; and Justice Barrett concurred in the partial grant and partial denial.\n\nThe litigation remains ongoing on two tracks: continued merits proceedings in the district court, and an active appeal in the First Circuit concerning the merits of the case.",

Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed the defendants failed to provide adequate reasoning, ignored their own policies, and improperly relied on external guidance that had not yet been formally adopted. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unreasonably delayed reviewing grant applications, and that the directives were unconstitutionally vague, violating the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. Finally, they asserted that the defendants violated the separation of powers by usurping Congress's legislative authority and ignoring statutory mandates.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory relief to have the court declare the defendants\u2019 actions unlawful and unconstitutional, along with temporary and permanent injunctions to prevent the enforcement of the directives, including further grant terminations and withholding of application reviews. They requested an order requiring NIH to restore the terminated grants retroactively and to review all properly submitted applications in accordance with existing NIH policies and strategic plans. Additionally, the plaintiffs sought regular status reports from the defendants confirming compliance with any court orders, an injunction protecting them from any retaliatory consequences for their involvement in the litigation, and an award of their reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a motion for a protective order. In the preliminary injunction motion, they sought the court\u2019s intervention to halt the ongoing disruption caused by the defendants\u2019 alleged unlawful and unconstitutional actions. In the protective order motion, the plaintiffs requested that the court safeguard the names and other identifying information of certain organizational declarants from unnecessary disclosure to the defendants and prevent their participation in the litigation from being used for any potentially retaliatory purposes.\n\nBetween April and June 2025, a wide range of academic institutions, professional associations, civil rights organizations, and attorneys general from 20 states and the District of Columbia filed a series of amicus briefs. These briefs collectively underscored the broad alarm within the scientific, academic, and public health communities regarding the sweeping implications of the challenged NIH policies. They emphasized the dangers of politicizing scientific grantmaking, warned against the erosion of established peer review protocols, and highlighted the discouraging effect on critical research related to marginalized populations, public health misinformation, and global health collaboration. Several amici also detailed the institutional and societal harms caused by abruptly halting ongoing projects\u2014pointing to disruptions to career trajectories, institutional partnerships, and public trust in federal research systems.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court held a status conference to clarify the procedural posture of the case, focusing on the defendants\u2019 earlier filings that raised jurisdictional and legal sufficiency challenges. During the conference, Judge Young and the parties discussed treating portions of the government\u2019s prior briefing as a de facto motion to dismiss. The judge noted that resolving these threshold legal issues early would help streamline the litigation. On May 28, 2025, Judge Young held a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs emphasized the immediate and irreversible harms resulting from the abrupt termination of their NIH-funded research, as well as the chilling effect on future scientific inquiry. The defendants responded that NIH had acted within its discretion in realigning grant priorities in accordance with updated government policy.\n\nThen, on May 30, 2025, Judge Young issued a Memorandum and Order formally resolving the construed motion to dismiss. 2025 WL 1548611. The court dismissed without prejudice Counts\u202fIV (vagueness under the APA), VI (vagueness under the Fifth Amendment), and VII (separation-of-powers claim), finding that they were either insufficiently pleaded or jurisdictionally improper. However, it denied dismissal as to the remaining claims\u2014Counts\u202fI\u2013III (arbitrary-and-capricious, failure-to-follow-law, statutory overreach) and Count\u202fV (unreasonable delay)\u2014allowing those claims to proceed. This order narrowed the litigation to the core equitable and statutory challenges related to grant reinstatement and procedural fairness, while preserving plaintiffs\u2019 ability to refile the dismissed constitutional claims at a later stage if appropriate.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, Judge Young issued a temporary order barring further grant terminations and granted the protective order in part, allowing limited redactions of declarant identities to prevent retaliation. That same day, he granted the preliminary injunction, concluding that NIH\u2019s termination of numerous grants was \u201carbitrary, unlawful, and discriminatory.\u201d The court ordered NIH to reinstate funding for affected grants and resume review of pending applications per established procedures\u2014emphasizing the unprecedented and unlawful nature of NIH\u2019s actions. The injunction took immediate effect.\n\nShortly after, on June 20, 2025, the defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss, arguing that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over certain claims, particularly those seeking monetary relief, which they contended must be brought in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. They also argued that some claims were nonjusticiable and that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue relief for future or speculative harms.\n\nThen, on June 23, 2025, Judge Young entered a partial final judgment, formally resolving the preliminary injunction and protective order rulings to permit immediate appellate review. 2025 WL 1747128. That same day, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the First Circuit and moved to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal. On June 24, Judge Young issued an order clarifying that the injunction remains in effect and that the June 23 partial final judgment only applied to the injunctive phase. 2025 WL 1745899.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss, asserting that their claims sought equitable relief, not monetary damages, and were properly within the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the court issued a supplemental judgment order, reaffirming that the earlier injunction would remain in force during the appeal and reiterating that the judgment covered only the resolved portion of the case. The next day, on July 3, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the district court\u2019s orders pending appeal, seeking expedited relief from the First Circuit to halt enforcement of the preliminary injunction. On July 4, 2025, the First Circuit denied the request for immediate relief and noted its intent to rule on the broader stay relief \"as soon as practicable\" after the completion of briefing.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the First Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal, holding that the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act to review the agency action and issue declaratory relief. The court found that the defendants had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on either their jurisdictional challenge or the merits. It also concluded that the balance of equities and the public interest favored the plaintiffs. The court declared the Directives void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated. Likewise, the resulting grant terminations were also declared void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated.\n\nFollowing the First Circuit\u2019s decision, the defendants submitted an application for a stay to the Supreme Court on July 24, 2025. They argued [https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/07/trump-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-pause-order-requiring-payment-of-grants/] that the district court lacked authority under federal law to compel the grant payments, citing a prior Supreme Court order permitting the Department of Education to suspend comparable funding. They also contended that the case belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court partially granted and partially denied the stay application. The court stayed the district court\u2019s judgments vacating the government\u2019s termination of research grants, reasoning that the court likely lacked jurisdiction over claims based on a contractual \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d which belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the government would face irreparable harm if funds were disbursed. However, the court denied the stay for judgments vacating the NIH guidance documents, finding that the government had failed to show irreparable harm from their vacatur. The decision was closely divided: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh favored granting the stay in full; the Chief Justice and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson favored denying it in full; and Justice Barrett concurred in the partial grant and partial denial.\n\nThe litigation remains ongoing on two tracks: continued merits proceedings in the district court, and an active appeal in the First Circuit concerning the merits of the case.",

    "target": "This case challenged the abrupt termination of numerous National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded research projects and the halting of grant application processes. On April 2, 2025, the American Public Health Association; IBIS Reproductive Health; International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW); and four private plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs, consisting of leading health research organizations and individual research scientists, sued the National Institutes of Health and the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiffs were represented by counsel from the Protect Democracy Project, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation. The case was initially assigned to Judge Murphy, but on May 1, 2025, he recused himself and the case was reassigned to Judge William G. Young.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from a series of government directives beginning in February 2025 aimed at terminating NIH-funded research on topics and populations the administration disfavored, including \u201cgender identity,\u201d \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u201d (DEI), \u201cvaccine hesitancy,\u201d and studies involving certain foreign entities. According to the complaint, these directives followed President Trump\u2019s January 2025 executive orders seeking to end equity-related programs and grants. The plaintiffs alleged that, in response, NIH issued guidance instructing staff to identify and terminate grants in these categories. This led to the abrupt termination of ongoing projects\u2014many years in progress with significant financial and time investments\u2014and the refusal to consider certain pending applications, including those aimed at diversifying researcher backgrounds. The plaintiffs argued that these terminations lacked scientifically valid reasons and disregarded established NIH protocols, which normally require non-compliance or cause to justify termination.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought seven claims, primarily under the Administrative Procedure Act , to challenge the defendants' actions, including the termination of grants, refusal to consider applications, and the issuance of new directives. The first three counts alleged that these actions were arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and exceeded statutory authority.

They requested an order requiring NIH to restore the terminated grants retroactively and to review all properly submitted applications in accordance with existing NIH policies and strategic plans. Additionally, the plaintiffs sought regular status reports from the defendants confirming compliance with any court orders, an injunction protecting them from any retaliatory consequences for their involvement in the litigation, and an award of their reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a motion for a protective order.

    "target": "This case challenged the abrupt termination of numerous National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded research projects and the halting of grant application processes. On April 2, 2025, the American Public Health Association; IBIS Reproductive Health; International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW); and four private plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs, consisting of leading health research organizations and individual research scientists, sued the National Institutes of Health and the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiffs were represented by counsel from the Protect Democracy Project, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation. The case was initially assigned to Judge Murphy, but on May 1, 2025, he recused himself and the case was reassigned to Judge William G. Young.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from a series of government directives beginning in February 2025 aimed at terminating NIH-funded research on topics and populations the administration disfavored, including \u201cgender identity,\u201d \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u201d (DEI), \u201cvaccine hesitancy,\u201d and studies involving certain foreign entities. According to the complaint, these directives followed President Trump\u2019s January 2025 executive orders seeking to end equity-related programs and grants. The plaintiffs alleged that, in response, NIH issued guidance instructing staff to identify and terminate grants in these categories. This led to the abrupt termination of ongoing projects\u2014many years in progress with significant financial and time investments\u2014and the refusal to consider certain pending applications, including those aimed at diversifying researcher backgrounds. The plaintiffs argued that these terminations lacked scientifically valid reasons and disregarded established NIH protocols, which normally require non-compliance or cause to justify termination.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought seven claims, primarily under the Administrative Procedure Act , to challenge the defendants' actions, including the termination of grants, refusal to consider applications, and the issuance of new directives. The first three counts alleged that these actions were arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and exceeded statutory authority. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed the defendants failed to provide adequate reasoning, ignored their own policies, and improperly relied on external guidance that had not yet been formally adopted. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unreasonably delayed reviewing grant applications, and that the directives were unconstitutionally vague, violating the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. Finally, they asserted that the defendants violated the separation of powers by usurping Congress's legislative authority and ignoring statutory mandates.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory relief to have the court declare the defendants\u2019 actions unlawful and unconstitutional, along with temporary and permanent injunctions to prevent the enforcement of the directives, including further grant terminations and withholding of application reviews. They requested an order requiring NIH to restore the terminated grants retroactively and to review all properly submitted applications in accordance with existing NIH policies and strategic plans. Additionally, the plaintiffs sought regular status reports from the defendants confirming compliance with any court orders, an injunction protecting them from any retaliatory consequences for their involvement in the litigation, and an award of their reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a motion for a protective order. In the preliminary injunction motion, they sought the court\u2019s intervention to halt the ongoing disruption caused by the defendants\u2019 alleged unlawful and unconstitutional actions. In the protective order motion, the plaintiffs requested that the court safeguard the names and other identifying information of certain organizational declarants from unnecessary disclosure to the defendants and prevent their participation in the litigation from being used for any potentially retaliatory purposes.\n\nBetween April and June 2025, a wide range of academic institutions, professional associations, civil rights organizations, and attorneys general from 20 states and the District of Columbia filed a series of amicus briefs. These briefs collectively underscored the broad alarm within the scientific, academic, and public health communities regarding the sweeping implications of the challenged NIH policies. They emphasized the dangers of politicizing scientific grantmaking, warned against the erosion of established peer review protocols, and highlighted the discouraging effect on critical research related to marginalized populations, public health misinformation, and global health collaboration. Several amici also detailed the institutional and societal harms caused by abruptly halting ongoing projects\u2014pointing to disruptions to career trajectories, institutional partnerships, and public trust in federal research systems.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court held a status conference to clarify the procedural posture of the case, focusing on the defendants\u2019 earlier filings that raised jurisdictional and legal sufficiency challenges. During the conference, Judge Young and the parties discussed treating portions of the government\u2019s prior briefing as a de facto motion to dismiss. The judge noted that resolving these threshold legal issues early would help streamline the litigation. On May 28, 2025, Judge Young held a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs emphasized the immediate and irreversible harms resulting from the abrupt termination of their NIH-funded research, as well as the chilling effect on future scientific inquiry. The defendants responded that NIH had acted within its discretion in realigning grant priorities in accordance with updated government policy.\n\nThen, on May 30, 2025, Judge Young issued a Memorandum and Order formally resolving the construed motion to dismiss. 2025 WL 1548611. The court dismissed without prejudice Counts\u202fIV (vagueness under the APA), VI (vagueness under the Fifth Amendment), and VII (separation-of-powers claim), finding that they were either insufficiently pleaded or jurisdictionally improper. However, it denied dismissal as to the remaining claims\u2014Counts\u202fI\u2013III (arbitrary-and-capricious, failure-to-follow-law, statutory overreach) and Count\u202fV (unreasonable delay)\u2014allowing those claims to proceed. This order narrowed the litigation to the core equitable and statutory challenges related to grant reinstatement and procedural fairness, while preserving plaintiffs\u2019 ability to refile the dismissed constitutional claims at a later stage if appropriate.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, Judge Young issued a temporary order barring further grant terminations and granted the protective order in part, allowing limited redactions of declarant identities to prevent retaliation. That same day, he granted the preliminary injunction, concluding that NIH\u2019s termination of numerous grants was \u201carbitrary, unlawful, and discriminatory.\u201d The court ordered NIH to reinstate funding for affected grants and resume review of pending applications per established procedures\u2014emphasizing the unprecedented and unlawful nature of NIH\u2019s actions. The injunction took immediate effect.\n\nShortly after, on June 20, 2025, the defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss, arguing that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over certain claims, particularly those seeking monetary relief, which they contended must be brought in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. They also argued that some claims were nonjusticiable and that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue relief for future or speculative harms.\n\nThen, on June 23, 2025, Judge Young entered a partial final judgment, formally resolving the preliminary injunction and protective order rulings to permit immediate appellate review. 2025 WL 1747128. That same day, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the First Circuit and moved to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal. On June 24, Judge Young issued an order clarifying that the injunction remains in effect and that the June 23 partial final judgment only applied to the injunctive phase. 2025 WL 1745899.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss, asserting that their claims sought equitable relief, not monetary damages, and were properly within the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the court issued a supplemental judgment order, reaffirming that the earlier injunction would remain in force during the appeal and reiterating that the judgment covered only the resolved portion of the case. The next day, on July 3, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the district court\u2019s orders pending appeal, seeking expedited relief from the First Circuit to halt enforcement of the preliminary injunction. On July 4, 2025, the First Circuit denied the request for immediate relief and noted its intent to rule on the broader stay relief \"as soon as practicable\" after the completion of briefing.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the First Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal, holding that the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act to review the agency action and issue declaratory relief. The court found that the defendants had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on either their jurisdictional challenge or the merits. It also concluded that the balance of equities and the public interest favored the plaintiffs. The court declared the Directives void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated. Likewise, the resulting grant terminations were also declared void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated.\n\nFollowing the First Circuit\u2019s decision, the defendants submitted an application for a stay to the Supreme Court on July 24, 2025. They argued [https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/07/trump-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-pause-order-requiring-payment-of-grants/] that the district court lacked authority under federal law to compel the grant payments, citing a prior Supreme Court order permitting the Department of Education to suspend comparable funding. They also contended that the case belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court partially granted and partially denied the stay application. The court stayed the district court\u2019s judgments vacating the government\u2019s termination of research grants, reasoning that the court likely lacked jurisdiction over claims based on a contractual \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d which belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the government would face irreparable harm if funds were disbursed. However, the court denied the stay for judgments vacating the NIH guidance documents, finding that the government had failed to show irreparable harm from their vacatur. The decision was closely divided: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh favored granting the stay in full; the Chief Justice and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson favored denying it in full; and Justice Barrett concurred in the partial grant and partial denial.\n\nThe litigation remains ongoing on two tracks: continued merits proceedings in the district court, and an active appeal in the First Circuit concerning the merits of the case.",

    "target": "This case challenged the abrupt termination of numerous National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded research projects and the halting of grant application processes. On April 2, 2025, the American Public Health Association; IBIS Reproductive Health; International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW); and four private plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs, consisting of leading health research organizations and individual research scientists, sued the National Institutes of Health and the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiffs were represented by counsel from the Protect Democracy Project, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation. The case was initially assigned to Judge Murphy, but on May 1, 2025, he recused himself and the case was reassigned to Judge William G. Young.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from a series of government directives beginning in February 2025 aimed at terminating NIH-funded research on topics and populations the administration disfavored, including \u201cgender identity,\u201d \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u201d (DEI), \u201cvaccine hesitancy,\u201d and studies involving certain foreign entities. According to the complaint, these directives followed President Trump\u2019s January 2025 executive orders seeking to end equity-related programs and grants. The plaintiffs alleged that, in response, NIH issued guidance instructing staff to identify and terminate grants in these categories. This led to the abrupt termination of ongoing projects\u2014many years in progress with significant financial and time investments\u2014and the refusal to consider certain pending applications, including those aimed at diversifying researcher backgrounds. The plaintiffs argued that these terminations lacked scientifically valid reasons and disregarded established NIH protocols, which normally require non-compliance or cause to justify termination.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought seven claims, primarily under the Administrative Procedure Act , to challenge the defendants' actions, including the termination of grants, refusal to consider applications, and the issuance of new directives. The first three counts alleged that these actions were arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and exceeded statutory authority. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed the defendants failed to provide adequate reasoning, ignored their own policies, and improperly relied on external guidance that had not yet been formally adopted. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unreasonably delayed reviewing grant applications, and that the directives were unconstitutionally vague, violating the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. Finally, they asserted that the defendants violated the separation of powers by usurping Congress's legislative authority and ignoring statutory mandates.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory relief to have the court declare the defendants\u2019 actions unlawful and unconstitutional, along with temporary and permanent injunctions to prevent the enforcement of the directives, including further grant terminations and withholding of application reviews. They requested an order requiring NIH to restore the terminated grants retroactively and to review all properly submitted applications in accordance with existing NIH policies and strategic plans. Additionally, the plaintiffs sought regular status reports from the defendants confirming compliance with any court orders, an injunction protecting them from any retaliatory consequences for their involvement in the litigation, and an award of their reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a motion for a protective order. In the preliminary injunction motion, they sought the court\u2019s intervention to halt the ongoing disruption caused by the defendants\u2019 alleged unlawful and unconstitutional actions. In the protective order motion, the plaintiffs requested that the court safeguard the names and other identifying information of certain organizational declarants from unnecessary disclosure to the defendants and prevent their participation in the litigation from being used for any potentially retaliatory purposes.\n\nBetween April and June 2025, a wide range of academic institutions, professional associations, civil rights organizations, and attorneys general from 20 states and the District of Columbia filed a series of amicus briefs. These briefs collectively underscored the broad alarm within the scientific, academic, and public health communities regarding the sweeping implications of the challenged NIH policies. They emphasized the dangers of politicizing scientific grantmaking, warned against the erosion of established peer review protocols, and highlighted the discouraging effect on critical research related to marginalized populations, public health misinformation, and global health collaboration. Several amici also detailed the institutional and societal harms caused by abruptly halting ongoing projects\u2014pointing to disruptions to career trajectories, institutional partnerships, and public trust in federal research systems.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court held a status conference to clarify the procedural posture of the case, focusing on the defendants\u2019 earlier filings that raised jurisdictional and legal sufficiency challenges. During the conference, Judge Young and the parties discussed treating portions of the government\u2019s prior briefing as a de facto motion to dismiss. The judge noted that resolving these threshold legal issues early would help streamline the litigation. On May 28, 2025, Judge Young held a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs emphasized the immediate and irreversible harms resulting from the abrupt termination of their NIH-funded research, as well as the chilling effect on future scientific inquiry. The defendants responded that NIH had acted within its discretion in realigning grant priorities in accordance with updated government policy.\n\nThen, on May 30, 2025, Judge Young issued a Memorandum and Order formally resolving the construed motion to dismiss. 2025 WL 1548611. The court dismissed without prejudice Counts\u202fIV (vagueness under the APA), VI (vagueness under the Fifth Amendment), and VII (separation-of-powers claim), finding that they were either insufficiently pleaded or jurisdictionally improper. However, it denied dismissal as to the remaining claims\u2014Counts\u202fI\u2013III (arbitrary-and-capricious, failure-to-follow-law, statutory overreach) and Count\u202fV (unreasonable delay)\u2014allowing those claims to proceed. This order narrowed the litigation to the core equitable and statutory challenges related to grant reinstatement and procedural fairness, while preserving plaintiffs\u2019 ability to refile the dismissed constitutional claims at a later stage if appropriate.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, Judge Young issued a temporary order barring further grant terminations and granted the protective order in part, allowing limited redactions of declarant identities to prevent retaliation. That same day, he granted the preliminary injunction, concluding that NIH\u2019s termination of numerous grants was \u201carbitrary, unlawful, and discriminatory.\u201d The court ordered NIH to reinstate funding for affected grants and resume review of pending applications per established procedures\u2014emphasizing the unprecedented and unlawful nature of NIH\u2019s actions. The injunction took immediate effect.\n\nShortly after, on June 20, 2025, the defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss, arguing that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over certain claims, particularly those seeking monetary relief, which they contended must be brought in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. They also argued that some claims were nonjusticiable and that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue relief for future or speculative harms.\n\nThen, on June 23, 2025, Judge Young entered a partial final judgment, formally resolving the preliminary injunction and protective order rulings to permit immediate appellate review. 2025 WL 1747128. That same day, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the First Circuit and moved to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal. On June 24, Judge Young issued an order clarifying that the injunction remains in effect and that the June 23 partial final judgment only applied to the injunctive phase. 2025 WL 1745899.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss, asserting that their claims sought equitable relief, not monetary damages, and were properly within the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the court issued a supplemental judgment order, reaffirming that the earlier injunction would remain in force during the appeal and reiterating that the judgment covered only the resolved portion of the case. The next day, on July 3, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the district court\u2019s orders pending appeal, seeking expedited relief from the First Circuit to halt enforcement of the preliminary injunction. On July 4, 2025, the First Circuit denied the request for immediate relief and noted its intent to rule on the broader stay relief \"as soon as practicable\" after the completion of briefing.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the First Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal, holding that the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act to review the agency action and issue declaratory relief. The court found that the defendants had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on either their jurisdictional challenge or the merits. It also concluded that the balance of equities and the public interest favored the plaintiffs. The court declared the Directives void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated. Likewise, the resulting grant terminations were also declared void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated.\n\nFollowing the First Circuit\u2019s decision, the defendants submitted an application for a stay to the Supreme Court on July 24, 2025. They argued [https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/07/trump-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-pause-order-requiring-payment-of-grants/] that the district court lacked authority under federal law to compel the grant payments, citing a prior Supreme Court order permitting the Department of Education to suspend comparable funding. They also contended that the case belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court partially granted and partially denied the stay application. The court stayed the district court\u2019s judgments vacating the government\u2019s termination of research grants, reasoning that the court likely lacked jurisdiction over claims based on a contractual \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d which belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the government would face irreparable harm if funds were disbursed. However, the court denied the stay for judgments vacating the NIH guidance documents, finding that the government had failed to show irreparable harm from their vacatur. The decision was closely divided: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh favored granting the stay in full; the Chief Justice and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson favored denying it in full; and Justice Barrett concurred in the partial grant and partial denial.\n\nThe litigation remains ongoing on two tracks: continued merits proceedings in the district court, and an active appeal in the First Circuit concerning the merits of the case.",

    "target": "This case challenged the abrupt termination of numerous National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded research projects and the halting of grant application processes. On April 2, 2025, the American Public Health Association; IBIS Reproductive Health; International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW); and four private plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs, consisting of leading health research organizations and individual research scientists, sued the National Institutes of Health and the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiffs were represented by counsel from the Protect Democracy Project, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation. The case was initially assigned to Judge Murphy, but on May 1, 2025, he recused himself and the case was reassigned to Judge William G. Young.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from a series of government directives beginning in February 2025 aimed at terminating NIH-funded research on topics and populations the administration disfavored, including \u201cgender identity,\u201d \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u201d (DEI), \u201cvaccine hesitancy,\u201d and studies involving certain foreign entities. According to the complaint, these directives followed President Trump\u2019s January 2025 executive orders seeking to end equity-related programs and grants. The plaintiffs alleged that, in response, NIH issued guidance instructing staff to identify and terminate grants in these categories. This led to the abrupt termination of ongoing projects\u2014many years in progress with significant financial and time investments\u2014and the refusal to consider certain pending applications, including those aimed at diversifying researcher backgrounds. The plaintiffs argued that these terminations lacked scientifically valid reasons and disregarded established NIH protocols, which normally require non-compliance or cause to justify termination.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought seven claims, primarily under the Administrative Procedure Act , to challenge the defendants' actions, including the termination of grants, refusal to consider applications, and the issuance of new directives. The first three counts alleged that these actions were arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and exceeded statutory authority. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed the defendants failed to provide adequate reasoning, ignored their own policies, and improperly relied on external guidance that had not yet been formally adopted. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unreasonably delayed reviewing grant applications, and that the directives were unconstitutionally vague, violating the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. Finally, they asserted that the defendants violated the separation of powers by usurping Congress's legislative authority and ignoring statutory mandates.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory relief to have the court declare the defendants\u2019 actions unlawful and unconstitutional, along with temporary and permanent injunctions to prevent the enforcement of the directives, including further grant terminations and withholding of application reviews. They requested an order requiring NIH to restore the terminated grants retroactively and to review all properly submitted applications in accordance with existing NIH policies and strategic plans. Additionally, the plaintiffs sought regular status reports from the defendants confirming compliance with any court orders, an injunction protecting them from any retaliatory consequences for their involvement in the litigation, and an award of their reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a motion for a protective order. In the preliminary injunction motion, they sought the court\u2019s intervention to halt the ongoing disruption caused by the defendants\u2019 alleged unlawful and unconstitutional actions. In the protective order motion, the plaintiffs requested that the court safeguard the names and other identifying information of certain organizational declarants from unnecessary disclosure to the defendants and prevent their participation in the litigation from being used for any potentially retaliatory purposes.\n\nBetween April and June 2025, a wide range of academic institutions, professional associations, civil rights organizations, and attorneys general from 20 states and the District of Columbia filed a series of amicus briefs. These briefs collectively underscored the broad alarm within the scientific, academic, and public health communities regarding the sweeping implications of the challenged NIH policies. They emphasized the dangers of politicizing scientific grantmaking, warned against the erosion of established peer review protocols, and highlighted the discouraging effect on critical research related to marginalized populations, public health misinformation, and global health collaboration. Several amici also detailed the institutional and societal harms caused by abruptly halting ongoing projects\u2014pointing to disruptions to career trajectories, institutional partnerships, and public trust in federal research systems.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court held a status conference to clarify the procedural posture of the case, focusing on the defendants\u2019 earlier filings that raised jurisdictional and legal sufficiency challenges. During the conference, Judge Young and the parties discussed treating portions of the government\u2019s prior briefing as a de facto motion to dismiss. The judge noted that resolving these threshold legal issues early would help streamline the litigation. On May 28, 2025, Judge Young held a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs emphasized the immediate and irreversible harms resulting from the abrupt termination of their NIH-funded research, as well as the chilling effect on future scientific inquiry. The defendants responded that NIH had acted within its discretion in realigning grant priorities in accordance with updated government policy.\n\nThen, on May 30, 2025, Judge Young issued a Memorandum and Order formally resolving the construed motion to dismiss. 2025 WL 1548611. The court dismissed without prejudice Counts\u202fIV (vagueness under the APA), VI (vagueness under the Fifth Amendment), and VII (separation-of-powers claim), finding that they were either insufficiently pleaded or jurisdictionally improper. However, it denied dismissal as to the remaining claims\u2014Counts\u202fI\u2013III (arbitrary-and-capricious, failure-to-follow-law, statutory overreach) and Count\u202fV (unreasonable delay)\u2014allowing those claims to proceed. This order narrowed the litigation to the core equitable and statutory challenges related to grant reinstatement and procedural fairness, while preserving plaintiffs\u2019 ability to refile the dismissed constitutional claims at a later stage if appropriate.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, Judge Young issued a temporary order barring further grant terminations and granted the protective order in part, allowing limited redactions of declarant identities to prevent retaliation. That same day, he granted the preliminary injunction, concluding that NIH\u2019s termination of numerous grants was \u201carbitrary, unlawful, and discriminatory.\u201d The court ordered NIH to reinstate funding for affected grants and resume review of pending applications per established procedures\u2014emphasizing the unprecedented and unlawful nature of NIH\u2019s actions. The injunction took immediate effect.\n\nShortly after, on June 20, 2025, the defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss, arguing that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over certain claims, particularly those seeking monetary relief, which they contended must be brought in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. They also argued that some claims were nonjusticiable and that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue relief for future or speculative harms.\n\nThen, on June 23, 2025, Judge Young entered a partial final judgment, formally resolving the preliminary injunction and protective order rulings to permit immediate appellate review. 2025 WL 1747128. That same day, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the First Circuit and moved to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal. On June 24, Judge Young issued an order clarifying that the injunction remains in effect and that the June 23 partial final judgment only applied to the injunctive phase. 2025 WL 1745899.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss, asserting that their claims sought equitable relief, not monetary damages, and were properly within the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the court issued a supplemental judgment order, reaffirming that the earlier injunction would remain in force during the appeal and reiterating that the judgment covered only the resolved portion of the case. The next day, on July 3, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the district court\u2019s orders pending appeal, seeking expedited relief from the First Circuit to halt enforcement of the preliminary injunction. On July 4, 2025, the First Circuit denied the request for immediate relief and noted its intent to rule on the broader stay relief \"as soon as practicable\" after the completion of briefing.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the First Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal, holding that the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act to review the agency action and issue declaratory relief. The court found that the defendants had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on either their jurisdictional challenge or the merits. It also concluded that the balance of equities and the public interest favored the plaintiffs. The court declared the Directives void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated. Likewise, the resulting grant terminations were also declared void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated.\n\nFollowing the First Circuit\u2019s decision, the defendants submitted an application for a stay to the Supreme Court on July 24, 2025. They argued [https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/07/trump-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-pause-order-requiring-payment-of-grants/] that the district court lacked authority under federal law to compel the grant payments, citing a prior Supreme Court order permitting the Department of Education to suspend comparable funding. They also contended that the case belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court partially granted and partially denied the stay application. The court stayed the district court\u2019s judgments vacating the government\u2019s termination of research grants, reasoning that the court likely lacked jurisdiction over claims based on a contractual \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d which belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the government would face irreparable harm if funds were disbursed. However, the court denied the stay for judgments vacating the NIH guidance documents, finding that the government had failed to show irreparable harm from their vacatur. The decision was closely divided: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh favored granting the stay in full; the Chief Justice and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson favored denying it in full; and Justice Barrett concurred in the partial grant and partial denial.\n\nThe litigation remains ongoing on two tracks: continued merits proceedings in the district court, and an active appeal in the First Circuit concerning the merits of the case.",
