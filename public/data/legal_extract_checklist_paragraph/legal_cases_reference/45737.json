    "target": "In the aftermath of George Floyd's death in May 2020, nationwide protests erupted, including a significant demonstration in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on May 31, 2020. During the protest, the Fort Lauderdale Police Department (FLPD) attempted to disperse the crowd through use of tear gas and kinetic impact projectiles, otherwise known as rubber bullets.\n\nThe plaintiff in this case, a participant in the May 2020 demonstration, alleged she was shot in the eye by a direct impound round, causing severe, painful, and permanent physical and emotional injuries. In response to her injuries, she filed a lawsuit against the City of Fort Lauderdale and several FLPD officers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on May 31, 2022. The eight-count complaint alleged violations of her constitutional rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as state law claims for battery and negligence. The plaintiff asserted municipal liability under a Monell \u201cfailure to train\u201d theory. The plaintiff sought damages, including punitive damages, prejudgment interest on liquidated damages, costs, and compensatory damages. The matter was assigned to District Judge Rodolfo Armando Ruiz II.\n\nThe plaintiff filed an amended complaint on October 27, 2022, wherein she revised the list of named FLDP defendants and added two additional counts: a claim against the City of Fort Lauderdale for negligent instruction, training, and supervision of its officers and a Fourteenth Amendment Procedural Due Process claim against all defendants, alleging that FLDP officers did not issue a proper dispersal order prior to deploying force. For these additional claims, the plaintiff sought compensatory damages, costs, and injunctive relief.\n\nOn November 2 and November 10, 2022, the defendants filed a pair of motions to dismiss. Judge Ruiz issued an order on June 1, 2023, granting in part the various motions. 2023 WL 3750581. Specifically, he dismissed without prejudice with leave to amend the plaintiff\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment claims, her Fourth Amendment claims, and, with respect to the city only, her First Amendment claim. Judge Ruiz also ordered the defendant to file a Second Amended Complaint in compliance with his order on or before June 23, 2023.\n\nAfter receiving an extension of time, the plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint on July 6, 2023. Among other things, the amended complaint pursued a bifurcated approach wherein the plaintiff alleged separate causes of action against the city and the other defendants, where applicable, and separated First Amendment claims into two claims\u2013one for unlawful restriction on speech and the other for retaliation. The complaint also provided a name for one of the three John Doe officers and included as an additional defendant the city\u2019s police chief.\n\nThe plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint on September 13, 2023, in which she made relatively modest changes to certain of her claims and removed references to one of the named FLPD defendants added in the Second Amended Complaint, substituting back John Doe 1.\n\nThe defendants sought summary judgment in a pair of filings made on December 5, 2023, and January 12, 2024. The plaintiff also filed a motion for partial summary judgment on January 12, 2024.\n\nOn September 4, 2024, Judge Ruiz issued an order granting in part and denying in part the various summary judgment motions. 2024 WL 4039849. Specifically, he granted summary judgment in favor of the individual defendants on all counts, citing both qualified and statutory immunity. With respect to the city, he denied summary judgment on the two First Amendment claims under the plaintiff\u2019s failure-to-train Monell theory and denied summary judgment as to the state-law battery claim, holding that it would be up to a jury to determine whether the city was liable for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries \u201cthrough its policies, procedures, and officers\u2019 conduct.\u201d\n\nOn October 28, 2024, before the case proceeded to trial, the parties attended mediation and came to a full and final settlement of all claims, pending final consideration and approval by the Fort Lauderdale City Commission. The city commission approved [https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article296526834.html] a $1.975 million settlement at its meeting on December 3, 2024. As part of the settlement, FLPD also agreed to overhaul its internal policies. The court approved the settlement on December 23, 2024.",

During the protest, the Fort Lauderdale Police Department (FLPD) attempted to disperse the crowd through use of tear gas and kinetic impact projectiles, otherwise known as rubber bullets.\n\nThe plaintiff in this case, a participant in the May 2020 demonstration, alleged she was shot in the eye by a direct impound round, causing severe, painful, and permanent physical and emotional injuries. In response to her injuries, she filed a lawsuit against the City of Fort Lauderdale and several FLPD officers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on May 31, 2022. The eight-count complaint alleged violations of her constitutional rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as state law claims for battery and negligence. The plaintiff asserted municipal liability under a Monell \u201cfailure to train\u201d theory. The plaintiff sought damages, including punitive damages, prejudgment interest on liquidated damages, costs, and compensatory damages. The matter was assigned to District Judge Rodolfo Armando Ruiz II.\n\nThe plaintiff filed an amended complaint on October 27, 2022, wherein she revised the list of named FLDP defendants and added two additional counts: a claim against the City of Fort Lauderdale for negligent instruction, training, and supervision of its officers and a Fourteenth Amendment Procedural Due Process claim against all defendants, alleging that FLDP officers did not issue a proper dispersal order prior to deploying force. For these additional claims, the plaintiff sought compensatory damages, costs, and injunctive relief.\n\nOn November 2 and November 10, 2022, the defendants filed a pair of motions to dismiss.

Judge Ruiz also ordered the defendant to file a Second Amended Complaint in compliance with his order on or before June 23, 2023.\n\nAfter receiving an extension of time, the plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint on July 6, 2023. Among other things, the amended complaint pursued a bifurcated approach wherein the plaintiff alleged separate causes of action against the city and the other defendants, where applicable, and separated First Amendment claims into two claims\u2013one for unlawful restriction on speech and the other for retaliation. The complaint also provided a name for one of the three John Doe officers and included as an additional defendant the city\u2019s police chief.\n\nThe plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint on September 13, 2023, in which she made relatively modest changes to certain of her claims and removed references to one of the named FLPD defendants added in the Second Amended Complaint, substituting back John Doe 1.\n\nThe defendants sought summary judgment in a pair of filings made on December 5, 2023, and January 12, 2024.

    "target": "In the aftermath of George Floyd's death in May 2020, nationwide protests erupted, including a significant demonstration in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on May 31, 2020. During the protest, the Fort Lauderdale Police Department (FLPD) attempted to disperse the crowd through use of tear gas and kinetic impact projectiles, otherwise known as rubber bullets.\n\nThe plaintiff in this case, a participant in the May 2020 demonstration, alleged she was shot in the eye by a direct impound round, causing severe, painful, and permanent physical and emotional injuries. In response to her injuries, she filed a lawsuit against the City of Fort Lauderdale and several FLPD officers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on May 31, 2022. The eight-count complaint alleged violations of her constitutional rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as state law claims for battery and negligence. The plaintiff asserted municipal liability under a Monell \u201cfailure to train\u201d theory. The plaintiff sought damages, including punitive damages, prejudgment interest on liquidated damages, costs, and compensatory damages. The matter was assigned to District Judge Rodolfo Armando Ruiz II.\n\nThe plaintiff filed an amended complaint on October 27, 2022, wherein she revised the list of named FLDP defendants and added two additional counts: a claim against the City of Fort Lauderdale for negligent instruction, training, and supervision of its officers and a Fourteenth Amendment Procedural Due Process claim against all defendants, alleging that FLDP officers did not issue a proper dispersal order prior to deploying force. For these additional claims, the plaintiff sought compensatory damages, costs, and injunctive relief.\n\nOn November 2 and November 10, 2022, the defendants filed a pair of motions to dismiss. Judge Ruiz issued an order on June 1, 2023, granting in part the various motions. 2023 WL 3750581. Specifically, he dismissed without prejudice with leave to amend the plaintiff\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment claims, her Fourth Amendment claims, and, with respect to the city only, her First Amendment claim. Judge Ruiz also ordered the defendant to file a Second Amended Complaint in compliance with his order on or before June 23, 2023.\n\nAfter receiving an extension of time, the plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint on July 6, 2023. Among other things, the amended complaint pursued a bifurcated approach wherein the plaintiff alleged separate causes of action against the city and the other defendants, where applicable, and separated First Amendment claims into two claims\u2013one for unlawful restriction on speech and the other for retaliation. The complaint also provided a name for one of the three John Doe officers and included as an additional defendant the city\u2019s police chief.\n\nThe plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint on September 13, 2023, in which she made relatively modest changes to certain of her claims and removed references to one of the named FLPD defendants added in the Second Amended Complaint, substituting back John Doe 1.\n\nThe defendants sought summary judgment in a pair of filings made on December 5, 2023, and January 12, 2024. The plaintiff also filed a motion for partial summary judgment on January 12, 2024.\n\nOn September 4, 2024, Judge Ruiz issued an order granting in part and denying in part the various summary judgment motions. 2024 WL 4039849. Specifically, he granted summary judgment in favor of the individual defendants on all counts, citing both qualified and statutory immunity. With respect to the city, he denied summary judgment on the two First Amendment claims under the plaintiff\u2019s failure-to-train Monell theory and denied summary judgment as to the state-law battery claim, holding that it would be up to a jury to determine whether the city was liable for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries \u201cthrough its policies, procedures, and officers\u2019 conduct.\u201d\n\nOn October 28, 2024, before the case proceeded to trial, the parties attended mediation and came to a full and final settlement of all claims, pending final consideration and approval by the Fort Lauderdale City Commission. The city commission approved [https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article296526834.html] a $1.975 million settlement at its meeting on December 3, 2024.

During the protest, the Fort Lauderdale Police Department (FLPD) attempted to disperse the crowd through use of tear gas and kinetic impact projectiles, otherwise known as rubber bullets.\n\nThe plaintiff in this case, a participant in the May 2020 demonstration, alleged she was shot in the eye by a direct impound round, causing severe, painful, and permanent physical and emotional injuries. In response to her injuries, she filed a lawsuit against the City of Fort Lauderdale and several FLPD officers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on May 31, 2022. The eight-count complaint alleged violations of her constitutional rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as state law claims for battery and negligence. The plaintiff asserted municipal liability under a Monell \u201cfailure to train\u201d theory. The plaintiff sought damages, including punitive damages, prejudgment interest on liquidated damages, costs, and compensatory damages. The matter was assigned to District Judge Rodolfo Armando Ruiz II.\n\nThe plaintiff filed an amended complaint on October 27, 2022, wherein she revised the list of named FLDP defendants and added two additional counts: a claim against the City of Fort Lauderdale for negligent instruction, training, and supervision of its officers and a Fourteenth Amendment Procedural Due Process claim against all defendants, alleging that FLDP officers did not issue a proper dispersal order prior to deploying force. For these additional claims, the plaintiff sought compensatory damages, costs, and injunctive relief.\n\nOn November 2 and November 10, 2022, the defendants filed a pair of motions to dismiss. Judge Ruiz issued an order on June 1, 2023, granting in part the various motions. 2023 WL 3750581. Specifically, he dismissed without prejudice with leave to amend the plaintiff\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment claims, her Fourth Amendment claims, and, with respect to the city only, her First Amendment claim. Judge Ruiz also ordered the defendant to file a Second Amended Complaint in compliance with his order on or before June 23, 2023.\n\nAfter receiving an extension of time, the plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint on July 6, 2023. Among other things, the amended complaint pursued a bifurcated approach wherein the plaintiff alleged separate causes of action against the city and the other defendants, where applicable, and separated First Amendment claims into two claims\u2013one for unlawful restriction on speech and the other for retaliation. The complaint also provided a name for one of the three John Doe officers and included as an additional defendant the city\u2019s police chief.\n\nThe plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint on September 13, 2023, in which she made relatively modest changes to certain of her claims and removed references to one of the named FLPD defendants added in the Second Amended Complaint, substituting back John Doe 1.\n\nThe defendants sought summary judgment in a pair of filings made on December 5, 2023, and January 12, 2024. The plaintiff also filed a motion for partial summary judgment on January 12, 2024.\n\nOn September 4, 2024, Judge Ruiz issued an order granting in part and denying in part the various summary judgment motions. 2024 WL 4039849. Specifically, he granted summary judgment in favor of the individual defendants on all counts, citing both qualified and statutory immunity. With respect to the city, he denied summary judgment on the two First Amendment claims under the plaintiff\u2019s failure-to-train Monell theory and denied summary judgment as to the state-law battery claim, holding that it would be up to a jury to determine whether the city was liable for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries \u201cthrough its policies, procedures, and officers\u2019 conduct.\u201d\n\nOn October 28, 2024, before the case proceeded to trial, the parties attended mediation and came to a full and final settlement of all claims, pending final consideration and approval by the Fort Lauderdale City Commission. The city commission approved [https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article296526834.html] a $1.975 million settlement at its meeting on December 3, 2024. As part of the settlement, FLPD also agreed to overhaul its internal policies. The court approved the settlement on December 23, 2024.",
