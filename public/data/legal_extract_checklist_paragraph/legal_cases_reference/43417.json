    "target": "On August 2, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho to protect what it alleged were rights of patients to access emergency abortion care guaranteed by federal law. The suit challenged Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622, which was set to go into effect on Aug. 25 and to impose a near-total ban on abortion. The complaint sought a declaratory judgment that \u00a7 18-622 conflicted with, and was preempted by, the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd, in situations where an abortion is necessary stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition, and an order permanently enjoining the Idaho law to the extent it conflicted with EMTALA. Idaho passed \u00a7 18-622 after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization [../../../../case/43153/].\n\nAccording to the DOJ complaint, EMTALA requires hospitals that receive federal Medicare funds to provide necessary stabilizing treatment to patients who arrive at their emergency departments while experiencing a medical emergency. When a physician reasonably determines that the necessary stabilizing treatment is an abortion, state law cannot prohibit the provision of that care. The federal statute defines necessary stabilizing treatment to include all treatment needed to ensure that a patient will not have her health placed in serious jeopardy, have her bodily functions seriously impaired, or suffer serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\n\nIdaho's \u00a7 18-622 authorized prosecutors to prosecute a physician merely by showing that an abortion has been performed, without regard to the circumstances. A physician who provides an abortion in Idaho could ultimately avoid criminal liability by establishing as an affirmative defense that \u201cthe abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d But the state law provided no defense for an abortion necessary to protect the health of the pregnant patient.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Barry Lynn Winmill. On August 8, 2022 the DOJ moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to EMTALA-mandated care. That same day the Idaho State Legislature moved to intervene as defendants. Judge Winmill granted in part and denied in part the Legislature\u2019s motion. Judge Winmill found that the Legislature could not intervene as a matter of right, since it did not show it sought to voice a different perspective than Idaho, or that Idaho would not adequately represent the Legislature's interests. However, Judge Winmill allowed the Legislature to intervene for the limited purpose of opposing the DOJ\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. The Legislature's participation was limited to presenting evidence and argument aimed at showing the alleged holes in the factual foundation of the DOJ\u2019s motion. 342 F.R.D. 144.\n\nOn August 17, 2022 Judge Winmill denied the Legislature\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing. Judge Winmill found the declarations on file provided a sufficient basis to make an informed decision and the bulk of the alleged factual dispute was actually a legal dispute: the meaning of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 and its overlap with EMTALA. 2022 WL 3442500.\n\nOn August 24, 2022 Judge Winmill granted the DOJ\u2019s preliminary injunction. Judge Winmill found it was not possible for healthcare workers to simultaneously comply with their obligations under EMTALA and Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622. The state law therefore had to yield to federal law under the Supremacy Clause. Even if it was possible to comply with both laws, Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 stood as a clear obstacle to what Congress was attempting to accomplish with EMTALA. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 would deter physicians from providing abortions in some emergency situations while EMTALA intended to ensure emergency care for patients in Medicare-funded hospitals.\n\nThe injunction restrained Idaho from enforcing Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to medical care required by EMTALA. Idaho was prohibited from initiating any criminal prosecution against, attempting to suspend or revoke the professional license of, or seeking to impose any other form of liability on, any medical provider or hospital based on their performance of conduct that is defined as an \u201cabortion\u201d under Idaho Code \u00a7 18-604(1), but that is necessary to avoid\u00a0(i) \u201cplacing the health of\u201d a pregnant patient \u201cin serious jeopardy\u201d; (ii) a \u201cserious impairment to bodily functions\u201d of the pregnant patient; or (iii) a \u201cserious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part\u201d of the pregnant patient. The preliminary injunction was effective immediately through the date on which judgment would be entered on the case. 623 F.Supp.3d 1096.\n\nIn September 2022, the Legislature and Idaho moved for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction. The court subsequently stayed issuance of a decision until the resolution of this motion.\u00a0In the interim, on October 4, 2022, the Legislature renewed its motion to intervene. On February 3, 2023, the court denied the Legislature's motion, holding that the Legislature and the State's interests overlapped fully such that the State would adequately represent the Legislature's interests. 2023 WL 1767387. On March 2, the Legislature appealed to the Ninth Circuit (23-35153).\n\nWhile the Legislature's appeal was pending, the lower court denied the State's motion for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction on May 4, 2023.\u00a0 The court considered the Idaho Supreme Court's January 2023 upholding of \u00a7 18-622 under the Idaho Constitution in Planned Parenthood Great Northwest v. State of [../../../../case/43579/] Idaho [../../../../case/43579/] [../../../../case/43579/], but concluded that the\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0decision did not negate the fundamental principles underpinning this court's preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction in this case did not rest on whether the abortion ban was consistent with the Idaho Constitution, but rather whether it conflicted with EMTALA. 2023 WL 3284977.\n\nOn June 28, 2023, Idaho appealed the initial order on motion for preliminary injunction and the order on motion for reconsideration to the Ninth Circuit (23-35440). On July 3, the Legislature also appealed the order on motion for reconsideration (23-35450). That same day, the Legislature also moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. On September 28, the Ninth Circuit granted that motion, staying the preliminary injunction pending appeal. It explained that the Idaho law likely did not conflict with EMTALA, that the preliminary injunction directly harmed Idaho's sovereignty, and that the balance of the equities and the public interest favored Idaho's right to enforce its legitimately enacted laws during the pendency of the appeal. 83 F.4th 1130. Separately, the Ninth Circuit also consolidated 23-35440 and 23-35450.\n\nOn September 30, 2023, the United States filed an emergency motion for reconsideration en banc of the stay pending appeal. On October 10, per a vote of the majority of nonrecused active judges, the Ninth Circuit ordered the matter be reheard en banc and vacated the stay. 82 F.4th 1296. On November 13, the Ninth Circuit denied the motion to stay, and therefore allowed the district court's injunction to remain in effect while the appeal was pending. \u00a02023 U.S. App. LEXIS 30135. While the appeals were pending, many states and municipalities submitted amicus briefs to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nOn November 20, 2023, both the Legislature (23-726) and Idaho (23-727) separately applied to the Supreme Court for a stay of the district court's preliminary injunction. On January 3, the Idaho Acting Solicitor General notified the Supreme Court of the Fifth Circuit's recent opinion in\u00a0Texas v. [../../../../case/43404/] Becerra [../../../../case/43404/] [../../../../case/43404/], which upheld a permanent injunction of federal guidance which had advised that EMTALA required abortions to be provided in emergency situations, even in jurisdictions with abortion bans. Two days later, the Supreme Court granted the application for stay, treated the application as a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment, and granted the petition. In response, the Ninth Circuit stayed its proceedings regarding its consideration of the preliminary injunction pending a decision by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in April 2024. On June 27, 2024, however, the Court issued a per curiam opinion, dismissing the case as improvidently granted and vacating the January 5 stay. The preliminary injunction was thus reinstated, and hospitals were able to perform emergency abortions in the state while the litigation continued in the lower courts.\n\nJustice Kagan concurred, joined by Justice Sotomayor (and joined in part by Justice Jackson), stating that \u201cIdaho\u2019s arguments about EMTALA do not justify, and have never justified, either emergency relief or our early consideration of this dispute,\u201d and that dismissing the case would allow the regular course of litigation in the lower courts. Justice Barrett also concurred, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh, because the \u201cshape of the [case]\u201d had \u201csubstantially shifted\u201d since the Court granted cert, and because the parties\u2019 positions had continued to evolve. Justice Jackson concurred in part and dissented in part, agreeing that the stay should have been lifted but asserting that the Court was wrong to dismiss the case as improvidently granted, and even suggesting that the Court used this procedural move to avoid an issue it did not wish to decide. Justice Alito dissented, joined by Justice Thomas and in part by Justice Gorsuch, stating that the Court\u2019s \u201cabout-face is baffling,\u201d because nothing \u201clegally relevant\u201d had occurred to change the circumstances of the case since the Court granted cert. Justice Alito offered an interpretation of EMTALA in his dissent, asserting that it did not require covered hospitals to perform abortions in violation of Idaho state law, but instead required hospitals to protect an \u201cunborn child\u201d from harm.\n\nOn remand, the Ninth Circuit ordered replacement briefing, and it held an en banc oral argument on December 10, 2024.\n\nHowever, after President Trump was inaugurated in January 2025, the Trump Administration switched sides on the issue, and dropped the lawsuit.\u00a0 On March 5, 2025, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal, without prejudice, applicable to all of the DOJ\u2019s claims. The case was thereby dismissed and the injunction dissolved. On March 13, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeals pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulated agreement.\n\nThe case is closed.",

The preliminary injunction was effective immediately through the date on which judgment would be entered on the case. 623 F.Supp.3d 1096.\n\nIn September 2022, the Legislature and Idaho moved for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction. The court subsequently stayed issuance of a decision until the resolution of this motion.\u00a0In the interim, on October 4, 2022, the Legislature renewed its motion to intervene. On February 3, 2023, the court denied the Legislature's motion, holding that the Legislature and the State's interests overlapped fully such that the State would adequately represent the Legislature's interests. 2023 WL 1767387. On March 2, the Legislature appealed to the Ninth Circuit (23-35153).\n\nWhile the Legislature's appeal was pending, the lower court denied the State's motion for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction on May 4, 2023.\u00a0 The court considered the Idaho Supreme Court's January 2023 upholding of \u00a7 18-622 under the Idaho Constitution in Planned Parenthood Great Northwest v. State of [../../../../case/43579/] Idaho [../../../../case/43579/] [../../../../case/43579/], but concluded that the\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0decision did not negate the fundamental principles underpinning this court's preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction in this case did not rest on whether the abortion ban was consistent with the Idaho Constitution, but rather whether it conflicted with EMTALA. 2023 WL 3284977.\n\nOn June 28, 2023, Idaho appealed the initial order on motion for preliminary injunction and the order on motion for reconsideration to the Ninth Circuit (23-35440). On July 3, the Legislature also appealed the order on motion for reconsideration (23-35450). That same day, the Legislature also moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. On September 28, the Ninth Circuit granted that motion, staying the preliminary injunction pending appeal. It explained that the Idaho law likely did not conflict with EMTALA, that the preliminary injunction directly harmed Idaho's sovereignty, and that the balance of the equities and the public interest favored Idaho's right to enforce its legitimately enacted laws during the pendency of the appeal. 83 F.4th 1130. Separately, the Ninth Circuit also consolidated 23-35440 and 23-35450.\n\nOn September 30, 2023, the United States filed an emergency motion for reconsideration en banc of the stay pending appeal. On October 10, per a vote of the majority of nonrecused active judges, the Ninth Circuit ordered the matter be reheard en banc and vacated the stay. 82 F.4th 1296. On November 13, the Ninth Circuit denied the motion to stay, and therefore allowed the district court's injunction to remain in effect while the appeal was pending. \u00a02023 U.S. App. LEXIS 30135. While the appeals were pending, many states and municipalities submitted amicus briefs to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nOn November 20, 2023, both the Legislature (23-726) and Idaho (23-727) separately applied to the Supreme Court for a stay of the district court's preliminary injunction. On January 3, the Idaho Acting Solicitor General notified the Supreme Court of the Fifth Circuit's recent opinion in\u00a0Texas v. [../../../../case/43404/] Becerra [../../../../case/43404/] [../../../../case/43404/], which upheld a permanent injunction of federal guidance which had advised that EMTALA required abortions to be provided in emergency situations, even in jurisdictions with abortion bans. Two days later, the Supreme Court granted the application for stay, treated the application as a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment, and granted the petition. In response, the Ninth Circuit stayed its proceedings regarding its consideration of the preliminary injunction pending a decision by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in April 2024. On June 27, 2024, however, the Court issued a per curiam opinion, dismissing the case as improvidently granted and vacating the January 5 stay. The preliminary injunction was thus reinstated, and hospitals were able to perform emergency abortions in the state while the litigation continued in the lower courts.\n\nJustice Kagan concurred, joined by Justice Sotomayor (and joined in part by Justice Jackson), stating that \u201cIdaho\u2019s arguments about EMTALA do not justify, and have never justified, either emergency relief or our early consideration of this dispute,\u201d and that dismissing the case would allow the regular course of litigation in the lower courts. Justice Barrett also concurred, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh, because the \u201cshape of the [case]\u201d had \u201csubstantially shifted\u201d since the Court granted cert, and because the parties\u2019 positions had continued to evolve. Justice Jackson concurred in part and dissented in part, agreeing that the stay should have been lifted but asserting that the Court was wrong to dismiss the case as improvidently granted, and even suggesting that the Court used this procedural move to avoid an issue it did not wish to decide. Justice Alito dissented, joined by Justice Thomas and in part by Justice Gorsuch, stating that the Court\u2019s \u201cabout-face is baffling,\u201d because nothing \u201clegally relevant\u201d had occurred to change the circumstances of the case since the Court granted cert. Justice Alito offered an interpretation of EMTALA in his dissent, asserting that it did not require covered hospitals to perform abortions in violation of Idaho state law, but instead required hospitals to protect an \u201cunborn child\u201d from harm.\n\nOn remand, the Ninth Circuit ordered replacement briefing, and it held an en banc oral argument on December 10, 2024.\n\nHowever, after President Trump was inaugurated in January 2025, the Trump Administration switched sides on the issue, and dropped the lawsuit.\u00a0 On March 5, 2025, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal, without prejudice, applicable to all of the DOJ\u2019s claims. The case was thereby dismissed and the injunction dissolved. On March 13, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeals pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulated agreement.\n\nThe case is closed.",

    "target": "On August 2, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho to protect what it alleged were rights of patients to access emergency abortion care guaranteed by federal law. The suit challenged Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622, which was set to go into effect on Aug. 25 and to impose a near-total ban on abortion. The complaint sought a declaratory judgment that \u00a7 18-622 conflicted with, and was preempted by, the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd, in situations where an abortion is necessary stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition, and an order permanently enjoining the Idaho law to the extent it conflicted with EMTALA. Idaho passed \u00a7 18-622 after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization [../../../../case/43153/].\n\nAccording to the DOJ complaint, EMTALA requires hospitals that receive federal Medicare funds to provide necessary stabilizing treatment to patients who arrive at their emergency departments while experiencing a medical emergency. When a physician reasonably determines that the necessary stabilizing treatment is an abortion, state law cannot prohibit the provision of that care. The federal statute defines necessary stabilizing treatment to include all treatment needed to ensure that a patient will not have her health placed in serious jeopardy, have her bodily functions seriously impaired, or suffer serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\n\nIdaho's \u00a7 18-622 authorized prosecutors to prosecute a physician merely by showing that an abortion has been performed, without regard to the circumstances. A physician who provides an abortion in Idaho could ultimately avoid criminal liability by establishing as an affirmative defense that \u201cthe abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d But the state law provided no defense for an abortion necessary to protect the health of the pregnant patient.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Barry Lynn Winmill. On August 8, 2022 the DOJ moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to EMTALA-mandated care. That same day the Idaho State Legislature moved to intervene as defendants. Judge Winmill granted in part and denied in part the Legislature\u2019s motion. Judge Winmill found that the Legislature could not intervene as a matter of right, since it did not show it sought to voice a different perspective than Idaho, or that Idaho would not adequately represent the Legislature's interests. However, Judge Winmill allowed the Legislature to intervene for the limited purpose of opposing the DOJ\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. The Legislature's participation was limited to presenting evidence and argument aimed at showing the alleged holes in the factual foundation of the DOJ\u2019s motion. 342 F.R.D. 144.\n\nOn August 17, 2022 Judge Winmill denied the Legislature\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing. Judge Winmill found the declarations on file provided a sufficient basis to make an informed decision and the bulk of the alleged factual dispute was actually a legal dispute: the meaning of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 and its overlap with EMTALA. 2022 WL 3442500.\n\nOn August 24, 2022 Judge Winmill granted the DOJ\u2019s preliminary injunction. Judge Winmill found it was not possible for healthcare workers to simultaneously comply with their obligations under EMTALA and Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622. The state law therefore had to yield to federal law under the Supremacy Clause. Even if it was possible to comply with both laws, Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 stood as a clear obstacle to what Congress was attempting to accomplish with EMTALA. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 would deter physicians from providing abortions in some emergency situations while EMTALA intended to ensure emergency care for patients in Medicare-funded hospitals.\n\nThe injunction restrained Idaho from enforcing Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to medical care required by EMTALA. Idaho was prohibited from initiating any criminal prosecution against, attempting to suspend or revoke the professional license of, or seeking to impose any other form of liability on, any medical provider or hospital based on their performance of conduct that is defined as an \u201cabortion\u201d under Idaho Code \u00a7 18-604(1), but that is necessary to avoid\u00a0(i) \u201cplacing the health of\u201d a pregnant patient \u201cin serious jeopardy\u201d; (ii) a \u201cserious impairment to bodily functions\u201d of the pregnant patient; or (iii) a \u201cserious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part\u201d of the pregnant patient.

Two days later, the Supreme Court granted the application for stay, treated the application as a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment, and granted the petition. In response, the Ninth Circuit stayed its proceedings regarding its consideration of the preliminary injunction pending a decision by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in April 2024. On June 27, 2024, however, the Court issued a per curiam opinion, dismissing the case as improvidently granted and vacating the January 5 stay. The preliminary injunction was thus reinstated, and hospitals were able to perform emergency abortions in the state while the litigation continued in the lower courts.\n\nJustice Kagan concurred, joined by Justice Sotomayor (and joined in part by Justice Jackson), stating that \u201cIdaho\u2019s arguments about EMTALA do not justify, and have never justified, either emergency relief or our early consideration of this dispute,\u201d and that dismissing the case would allow the regular course of litigation in the lower courts. Justice Barrett also concurred, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh, because the \u201cshape of the [case]\u201d had \u201csubstantially shifted\u201d since the Court granted cert, and because the parties\u2019 positions had continued to evolve. Justice Jackson concurred in part and dissented in part, agreeing that the stay should have been lifted but asserting that the Court was wrong to dismiss the case as improvidently granted, and even suggesting that the Court used this procedural move to avoid an issue it did not wish to decide. Justice Alito dissented, joined by Justice Thomas and in part by Justice Gorsuch, stating that the Court\u2019s \u201cabout-face is baffling,\u201d because nothing \u201clegally relevant\u201d had occurred to change the circumstances of the case since the Court granted cert. Justice Alito offered an interpretation of EMTALA in his dissent, asserting that it did not require covered hospitals to perform abortions in violation of Idaho state law, but instead required hospitals to protect an \u201cunborn child\u201d from harm.\n\nOn remand, the Ninth Circuit ordered replacement briefing, and it held an en banc oral argument on December 10, 2024.\n\nHowever, after President Trump was inaugurated in January 2025, the Trump Administration switched sides on the issue, and dropped the lawsuit.\u00a0 On March 5, 2025, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal, without prejudice, applicable to all of the DOJ\u2019s claims. The case was thereby dismissed and the injunction dissolved. On March 13, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeals pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulated agreement.\n\nThe case is closed.",

    "target": "On August 2, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho to protect what it alleged were rights of patients to access emergency abortion care guaranteed by federal law. The suit challenged Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622, which was set to go into effect on Aug. 25 and to impose a near-total ban on abortion. The complaint sought a declaratory judgment that \u00a7 18-622 conflicted with, and was preempted by, the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd, in situations where an abortion is necessary stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition, and an order permanently enjoining the Idaho law to the extent it conflicted with EMTALA. Idaho passed \u00a7 18-622 after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization [../../../../case/43153/].\n\nAccording to the DOJ complaint, EMTALA requires hospitals that receive federal Medicare funds to provide necessary stabilizing treatment to patients who arrive at their emergency departments while experiencing a medical emergency. When a physician reasonably determines that the necessary stabilizing treatment is an abortion, state law cannot prohibit the provision of that care. The federal statute defines necessary stabilizing treatment to include all treatment needed to ensure that a patient will not have her health placed in serious jeopardy, have her bodily functions seriously impaired, or suffer serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\n\nIdaho's \u00a7 18-622 authorized prosecutors to prosecute a physician merely by showing that an abortion has been performed, without regard to the circumstances. A physician who provides an abortion in Idaho could ultimately avoid criminal liability by establishing as an affirmative defense that \u201cthe abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d But the state law provided no defense for an abortion necessary to protect the health of the pregnant patient.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Barry Lynn Winmill. On August 8, 2022 the DOJ moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to EMTALA-mandated care. That same day the Idaho State Legislature moved to intervene as defendants. Judge Winmill granted in part and denied in part the Legislature\u2019s motion. Judge Winmill found that the Legislature could not intervene as a matter of right, since it did not show it sought to voice a different perspective than Idaho, or that Idaho would not adequately represent the Legislature's interests. However, Judge Winmill allowed the Legislature to intervene for the limited purpose of opposing the DOJ\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. The Legislature's participation was limited to presenting evidence and argument aimed at showing the alleged holes in the factual foundation of the DOJ\u2019s motion. 342 F.R.D. 144.\n\nOn August 17, 2022 Judge Winmill denied the Legislature\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing. Judge Winmill found the declarations on file provided a sufficient basis to make an informed decision and the bulk of the alleged factual dispute was actually a legal dispute: the meaning of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 and its overlap with EMTALA. 2022 WL 3442500.\n\nOn August 24, 2022 Judge Winmill granted the DOJ\u2019s preliminary injunction. Judge Winmill found it was not possible for healthcare workers to simultaneously comply with their obligations under EMTALA and Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622. The state law therefore had to yield to federal law under the Supremacy Clause. Even if it was possible to comply with both laws, Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 stood as a clear obstacle to what Congress was attempting to accomplish with EMTALA. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 would deter physicians from providing abortions in some emergency situations while EMTALA intended to ensure emergency care for patients in Medicare-funded hospitals.\n\nThe injunction restrained Idaho from enforcing Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to medical care required by EMTALA. Idaho was prohibited from initiating any criminal prosecution against, attempting to suspend or revoke the professional license of, or seeking to impose any other form of liability on, any medical provider or hospital based on their performance of conduct that is defined as an \u201cabortion\u201d under Idaho Code \u00a7 18-604(1), but that is necessary to avoid\u00a0(i) \u201cplacing the health of\u201d a pregnant patient \u201cin serious jeopardy\u201d; (ii) a \u201cserious impairment to bodily functions\u201d of the pregnant patient; or (iii) a \u201cserious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part\u201d of the pregnant patient. The preliminary injunction was effective immediately through the date on which judgment would be entered on the case. 623 F.Supp.3d 1096.\n\nIn September 2022, the Legislature and Idaho moved for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction. The court subsequently stayed issuance of a decision until the resolution of this motion.\u00a0In the interim, on October 4, 2022, the Legislature renewed its motion to intervene. On February 3, 2023, the court denied the Legislature's motion, holding that the Legislature and the State's interests overlapped fully such that the State would adequately represent the Legislature's interests. 2023 WL 1767387. On March 2, the Legislature appealed to the Ninth Circuit (23-35153).\n\nWhile the Legislature's appeal was pending, the lower court denied the State's motion for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction on May 4, 2023.\u00a0 The court considered the Idaho Supreme Court's January 2023 upholding of \u00a7 18-622 under the Idaho Constitution in Planned Parenthood Great Northwest v. State of [../../../../case/43579/] Idaho [../../../../case/43579/] [../../../../case/43579/], but concluded that the\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0decision did not negate the fundamental principles underpinning this court's preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction in this case did not rest on whether the abortion ban was consistent with the Idaho Constitution, but rather whether it conflicted with EMTALA. 2023 WL 3284977.\n\nOn June 28, 2023, Idaho appealed the initial order on motion for preliminary injunction and the order on motion for reconsideration to the Ninth Circuit (23-35440). On July 3, the Legislature also appealed the order on motion for reconsideration (23-35450). That same day, the Legislature also moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. On September 28, the Ninth Circuit granted that motion, staying the preliminary injunction pending appeal. It explained that the Idaho law likely did not conflict with EMTALA, that the preliminary injunction directly harmed Idaho's sovereignty, and that the balance of the equities and the public interest favored Idaho's right to enforce its legitimately enacted laws during the pendency of the appeal. 83 F.4th 1130. Separately, the Ninth Circuit also consolidated 23-35440 and 23-35450.\n\nOn September 30, 2023, the United States filed an emergency motion for reconsideration en banc of the stay pending appeal. On October 10, per a vote of the majority of nonrecused active judges, the Ninth Circuit ordered the matter be reheard en banc and vacated the stay. 82 F.4th 1296. On November 13, the Ninth Circuit denied the motion to stay, and therefore allowed the district court's injunction to remain in effect while the appeal was pending. \u00a02023 U.S. App. LEXIS 30135. While the appeals were pending, many states and municipalities submitted amicus briefs to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nOn November 20, 2023, both the Legislature (23-726) and Idaho (23-727) separately applied to the Supreme Court for a stay of the district court's preliminary injunction. On January 3, the Idaho Acting Solicitor General notified the Supreme Court of the Fifth Circuit's recent opinion in\u00a0Texas v. [../../../../case/43404/] Becerra [../../../../case/43404/] [../../../../case/43404/], which upheld a permanent injunction of federal guidance which had advised that EMTALA required abortions to be provided in emergency situations, even in jurisdictions with abortion bans. Two days later, the Supreme Court granted the application for stay, treated the application as a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment, and granted the petition. In response, the Ninth Circuit stayed its proceedings regarding its consideration of the preliminary injunction pending a decision by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in April 2024. On June 27, 2024, however, the Court issued a per curiam opinion, dismissing the case as improvidently granted and vacating the January 5 stay. The preliminary injunction was thus reinstated, and hospitals were able to perform emergency abortions in the state while the litigation continued in the lower courts.\n\nJustice Kagan concurred, joined by Justice Sotomayor (and joined in part by Justice Jackson), stating that \u201cIdaho\u2019s arguments about EMTALA do not justify, and have never justified, either emergency relief or our early consideration of this dispute,\u201d and that dismissing the case would allow the regular course of litigation in the lower courts. Justice Barrett also concurred, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh, because the \u201cshape of the [case]\u201d had \u201csubstantially shifted\u201d since the Court granted cert, and because the parties\u2019 positions had continued to evolve. Justice Jackson concurred in part and dissented in part, agreeing that the stay should have been lifted but asserting that the Court was wrong to dismiss the case as improvidently granted, and even suggesting that the Court used this procedural move to avoid an issue it did not wish to decide. Justice Alito dissented, joined by Justice Thomas and in part by Justice Gorsuch, stating that the Court\u2019s \u201cabout-face is baffling,\u201d because nothing \u201clegally relevant\u201d had occurred to change the circumstances of the case since the Court granted cert. Justice Alito offered an interpretation of EMTALA in his dissent, asserting that it did not require covered hospitals to perform abortions in violation of Idaho state law, but instead required hospitals to protect an \u201cunborn child\u201d from harm.\n\nOn remand, the Ninth Circuit ordered replacement briefing, and it held an en banc oral argument on December 10, 2024.\n\nHowever, after President Trump was inaugurated in January 2025, the Trump Administration switched sides on the issue, and dropped the lawsuit.\u00a0 On March 5, 2025, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal, without prejudice, applicable to all of the DOJ\u2019s claims. The case was thereby dismissed and the injunction dissolved. On March 13, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeals pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulated agreement.\n\nThe case is closed.",

    "target": "On August 2, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho to protect what it alleged were rights of patients to access emergency abortion care guaranteed by federal law. The suit challenged Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622, which was set to go into effect on Aug. 25 and to impose a near-total ban on abortion. The complaint sought a declaratory judgment that \u00a7 18-622 conflicted with, and was preempted by, the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd, in situations where an abortion is necessary stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition, and an order permanently enjoining the Idaho law to the extent it conflicted with EMTALA. Idaho passed \u00a7 18-622 after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization [../../../../case/43153/].\n\nAccording to the DOJ complaint, EMTALA requires hospitals that receive federal Medicare funds to provide necessary stabilizing treatment to patients who arrive at their emergency departments while experiencing a medical emergency. When a physician reasonably determines that the necessary stabilizing treatment is an abortion, state law cannot prohibit the provision of that care. The federal statute defines necessary stabilizing treatment to include all treatment needed to ensure that a patient will not have her health placed in serious jeopardy, have her bodily functions seriously impaired, or suffer serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\n\nIdaho's \u00a7 18-622 authorized prosecutors to prosecute a physician merely by showing that an abortion has been performed, without regard to the circumstances. A physician who provides an abortion in Idaho could ultimately avoid criminal liability by establishing as an affirmative defense that \u201cthe abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d But the state law provided no defense for an abortion necessary to protect the health of the pregnant patient.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Barry Lynn Winmill. On August 8, 2022 the DOJ moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to EMTALA-mandated care. That same day the Idaho State Legislature moved to intervene as defendants. Judge Winmill granted in part and denied in part the Legislature\u2019s motion. Judge Winmill found that the Legislature could not intervene as a matter of right, since it did not show it sought to voice a different perspective than Idaho, or that Idaho would not adequately represent the Legislature's interests. However, Judge Winmill allowed the Legislature to intervene for the limited purpose of opposing the DOJ\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. The Legislature's participation was limited to presenting evidence and argument aimed at showing the alleged holes in the factual foundation of the DOJ\u2019s motion. 342 F.R.D. 144.\n\nOn August 17, 2022 Judge Winmill denied the Legislature\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing. Judge Winmill found the declarations on file provided a sufficient basis to make an informed decision and the bulk of the alleged factual dispute was actually a legal dispute: the meaning of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 and its overlap with EMTALA. 2022 WL 3442500.\n\nOn August 24, 2022 Judge Winmill granted the DOJ\u2019s preliminary injunction. Judge Winmill found it was not possible for healthcare workers to simultaneously comply with their obligations under EMTALA and Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622. The state law therefore had to yield to federal law under the Supremacy Clause. Even if it was possible to comply with both laws, Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 stood as a clear obstacle to what Congress was attempting to accomplish with EMTALA. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 would deter physicians from providing abortions in some emergency situations while EMTALA intended to ensure emergency care for patients in Medicare-funded hospitals.\n\nThe injunction restrained Idaho from enforcing Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to medical care required by EMTALA. Idaho was prohibited from initiating any criminal prosecution against, attempting to suspend or revoke the professional license of, or seeking to impose any other form of liability on, any medical provider or hospital based on their performance of conduct that is defined as an \u201cabortion\u201d under Idaho Code \u00a7 18-604(1), but that is necessary to avoid\u00a0(i) \u201cplacing the health of\u201d a pregnant patient \u201cin serious jeopardy\u201d; (ii) a \u201cserious impairment to bodily functions\u201d of the pregnant patient; or (iii) a \u201cserious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part\u201d of the pregnant patient. The preliminary injunction was effective immediately through the date on which judgment would be entered on the case. 623 F.Supp.3d 1096.\n\nIn September 2022, the Legislature and Idaho moved for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction. The court subsequently stayed issuance of a decision until the resolution of this motion.\u00a0In the interim, on October 4, 2022, the Legislature renewed its motion to intervene. On February 3, 2023, the court denied the Legislature's motion, holding that the Legislature and the State's interests overlapped fully such that the State would adequately represent the Legislature's interests. 2023 WL 1767387. On March 2, the Legislature appealed to the Ninth Circuit (23-35153).\n\nWhile the Legislature's appeal was pending, the lower court denied the State's motion for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction on May 4, 2023.\u00a0 The court considered the Idaho Supreme Court's January 2023 upholding of \u00a7 18-622 under the Idaho Constitution in Planned Parenthood Great Northwest v. State of [../../../../case/43579/] Idaho [../../../../case/43579/] [../../../../case/43579/], but concluded that the\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0decision did not negate the fundamental principles underpinning this court's preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction in this case did not rest on whether the abortion ban was consistent with the Idaho Constitution, but rather whether it conflicted with EMTALA. 2023 WL 3284977.\n\nOn June 28, 2023, Idaho appealed the initial order on motion for preliminary injunction and the order on motion for reconsideration to the Ninth Circuit (23-35440). On July 3, the Legislature also appealed the order on motion for reconsideration (23-35450). That same day, the Legislature also moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. On September 28, the Ninth Circuit granted that motion, staying the preliminary injunction pending appeal. It explained that the Idaho law likely did not conflict with EMTALA, that the preliminary injunction directly harmed Idaho's sovereignty, and that the balance of the equities and the public interest favored Idaho's right to enforce its legitimately enacted laws during the pendency of the appeal. 83 F.4th 1130. Separately, the Ninth Circuit also consolidated 23-35440 and 23-35450.\n\nOn September 30, 2023, the United States filed an emergency motion for reconsideration en banc of the stay pending appeal. On October 10, per a vote of the majority of nonrecused active judges, the Ninth Circuit ordered the matter be reheard en banc and vacated the stay. 82 F.4th 1296. On November 13, the Ninth Circuit denied the motion to stay, and therefore allowed the district court's injunction to remain in effect while the appeal was pending. \u00a02023 U.S. App. LEXIS 30135. While the appeals were pending, many states and municipalities submitted amicus briefs to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nOn November 20, 2023, both the Legislature (23-726) and Idaho (23-727) separately applied to the Supreme Court for a stay of the district court's preliminary injunction. On January 3, the Idaho Acting Solicitor General notified the Supreme Court of the Fifth Circuit's recent opinion in\u00a0Texas v. [../../../../case/43404/] Becerra [../../../../case/43404/] [../../../../case/43404/], which upheld a permanent injunction of federal guidance which had advised that EMTALA required abortions to be provided in emergency situations, even in jurisdictions with abortion bans. Two days later, the Supreme Court granted the application for stay, treated the application as a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment, and granted the petition. In response, the Ninth Circuit stayed its proceedings regarding its consideration of the preliminary injunction pending a decision by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in April 2024. On June 27, 2024, however, the Court issued a per curiam opinion, dismissing the case as improvidently granted and vacating the January 5 stay. The preliminary injunction was thus reinstated, and hospitals were able to perform emergency abortions in the state while the litigation continued in the lower courts.\n\nJustice Kagan concurred, joined by Justice Sotomayor (and joined in part by Justice Jackson), stating that \u201cIdaho\u2019s arguments about EMTALA do not justify, and have never justified, either emergency relief or our early consideration of this dispute,\u201d and that dismissing the case would allow the regular course of litigation in the lower courts. Justice Barrett also concurred, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh, because the \u201cshape of the [case]\u201d had \u201csubstantially shifted\u201d since the Court granted cert, and because the parties\u2019 positions had continued to evolve. Justice Jackson concurred in part and dissented in part, agreeing that the stay should have been lifted but asserting that the Court was wrong to dismiss the case as improvidently granted, and even suggesting that the Court used this procedural move to avoid an issue it did not wish to decide. Justice Alito dissented, joined by Justice Thomas and in part by Justice Gorsuch, stating that the Court\u2019s \u201cabout-face is baffling,\u201d because nothing \u201clegally relevant\u201d had occurred to change the circumstances of the case since the Court granted cert. Justice Alito offered an interpretation of EMTALA in his dissent, asserting that it did not require covered hospitals to perform abortions in violation of Idaho state law, but instead required hospitals to protect an \u201cunborn child\u201d from harm.\n\nOn remand, the Ninth Circuit ordered replacement briefing, and it held an en banc oral argument on December 10, 2024.\n\nHowever, after President Trump was inaugurated in January 2025, the Trump Administration switched sides on the issue, and dropped the lawsuit.\u00a0 On March 5, 2025, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal, without prejudice, applicable to all of the DOJ\u2019s claims. The case was thereby dismissed and the injunction dissolved. On March 13, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeals pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulated agreement.\n\nThe case is closed.",

Separately, the Ninth Circuit also consolidated 23-35440 and 23-35450.\n\nOn September 30, 2023, the United States filed an emergency motion for reconsideration en banc of the stay pending appeal. On October 10, per a vote of the majority of nonrecused active judges, the Ninth Circuit ordered the matter be reheard en banc and vacated the stay. 82 F.4th 1296. On November 13, the Ninth Circuit denied the motion to stay, and therefore allowed the district court's injunction to remain in effect while the appeal was pending. \u00a02023 U.S. App. LEXIS 30135. While the appeals were pending, many states and municipalities submitted amicus briefs to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nOn November 20, 2023, both the Legislature (23-726) and Idaho (23-727) separately applied to the Supreme Court for a stay of the district court's preliminary injunction. On January 3, the Idaho Acting Solicitor General notified the Supreme Court of the Fifth Circuit's recent opinion in\u00a0Texas v. [../../../../case/43404/] Becerra [../../../../case/43404/] [../../../../case/43404/], which upheld a permanent injunction of federal guidance which had advised that EMTALA required abortions to be provided in emergency situations, even in jurisdictions with abortion bans. Two days later, the Supreme Court granted the application for stay, treated the application as a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment, and granted the petition. In response, the Ninth Circuit stayed its proceedings regarding its consideration of the preliminary injunction pending a decision by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in April 2024. On June 27, 2024, however, the Court issued a per curiam opinion, dismissing the case as improvidently granted and vacating the January 5 stay. The preliminary injunction was thus reinstated, and hospitals were able to perform emergency abortions in the state while the litigation continued in the lower courts.\n\nJustice Kagan concurred, joined by Justice Sotomayor (and joined in part by Justice Jackson), stating that \u201cIdaho\u2019s arguments about EMTALA do not justify, and have never justified, either emergency relief or our early consideration of this dispute,\u201d and that dismissing the case would allow the regular course of litigation in the lower courts. Justice Barrett also concurred, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh, because the \u201cshape of the [case]\u201d had \u201csubstantially shifted\u201d since the Court granted cert, and because the parties\u2019 positions had continued to evolve. Justice Jackson concurred in part and dissented in part, agreeing that the stay should have been lifted but asserting that the Court was wrong to dismiss the case as improvidently granted, and even suggesting that the Court used this procedural move to avoid an issue it did not wish to decide. Justice Alito dissented, joined by Justice Thomas and in part by Justice Gorsuch, stating that the Court\u2019s \u201cabout-face is baffling,\u201d because nothing \u201clegally relevant\u201d had occurred to change the circumstances of the case since the Court granted cert. Justice Alito offered an interpretation of EMTALA in his dissent, asserting that it did not require covered hospitals to perform abortions in violation of Idaho state law, but instead required hospitals to protect an \u201cunborn child\u201d from harm.\n\nOn remand, the Ninth Circuit ordered replacement briefing, and it held an en banc oral argument on December 10, 2024.\n\nHowever, after President Trump was inaugurated in January 2025, the Trump Administration switched sides on the issue, and dropped the lawsuit.\u00a0 On March 5, 2025, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal, without prejudice, applicable to all of the DOJ\u2019s claims. The case was thereby dismissed and the injunction dissolved. On March 13, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeals pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulated agreement.\n\nThe case is closed.",

    "target": "On August 2, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho to protect what it alleged were rights of patients to access emergency abortion care guaranteed by federal law. The suit challenged Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622, which was set to go into effect on Aug. 25 and to impose a near-total ban on abortion. The complaint sought a declaratory judgment that \u00a7 18-622 conflicted with, and was preempted by, the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd, in situations where an abortion is necessary stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition, and an order permanently enjoining the Idaho law to the extent it conflicted with EMTALA. Idaho passed \u00a7 18-622 after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization [../../../../case/43153/].\n\nAccording to the DOJ complaint, EMTALA requires hospitals that receive federal Medicare funds to provide necessary stabilizing treatment to patients who arrive at their emergency departments while experiencing a medical emergency. When a physician reasonably determines that the necessary stabilizing treatment is an abortion, state law cannot prohibit the provision of that care. The federal statute defines necessary stabilizing treatment to include all treatment needed to ensure that a patient will not have her health placed in serious jeopardy, have her bodily functions seriously impaired, or suffer serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\n\nIdaho's \u00a7 18-622 authorized prosecutors to prosecute a physician merely by showing that an abortion has been performed, without regard to the circumstances. A physician who provides an abortion in Idaho could ultimately avoid criminal liability by establishing as an affirmative defense that \u201cthe abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d But the state law provided no defense for an abortion necessary to protect the health of the pregnant patient.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Barry Lynn Winmill. On August 8, 2022 the DOJ moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to EMTALA-mandated care. That same day the Idaho State Legislature moved to intervene as defendants. Judge Winmill granted in part and denied in part the Legislature\u2019s motion. Judge Winmill found that the Legislature could not intervene as a matter of right, since it did not show it sought to voice a different perspective than Idaho, or that Idaho would not adequately represent the Legislature's interests. However, Judge Winmill allowed the Legislature to intervene for the limited purpose of opposing the DOJ\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. The Legislature's participation was limited to presenting evidence and argument aimed at showing the alleged holes in the factual foundation of the DOJ\u2019s motion. 342 F.R.D. 144.\n\nOn August 17, 2022 Judge Winmill denied the Legislature\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing. Judge Winmill found the declarations on file provided a sufficient basis to make an informed decision and the bulk of the alleged factual dispute was actually a legal dispute: the meaning of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 and its overlap with EMTALA. 2022 WL 3442500.\n\nOn August 24, 2022 Judge Winmill granted the DOJ\u2019s preliminary injunction. Judge Winmill found it was not possible for healthcare workers to simultaneously comply with their obligations under EMTALA and Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622. The state law therefore had to yield to federal law under the Supremacy Clause. Even if it was possible to comply with both laws, Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 stood as a clear obstacle to what Congress was attempting to accomplish with EMTALA. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 would deter physicians from providing abortions in some emergency situations while EMTALA intended to ensure emergency care for patients in Medicare-funded hospitals.\n\nThe injunction restrained Idaho from enforcing Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to medical care required by EMTALA. Idaho was prohibited from initiating any criminal prosecution against, attempting to suspend or revoke the professional license of, or seeking to impose any other form of liability on, any medical provider or hospital based on their performance of conduct that is defined as an \u201cabortion\u201d under Idaho Code \u00a7 18-604(1), but that is necessary to avoid\u00a0(i) \u201cplacing the health of\u201d a pregnant patient \u201cin serious jeopardy\u201d; (ii) a \u201cserious impairment to bodily functions\u201d of the pregnant patient; or (iii) a \u201cserious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part\u201d of the pregnant patient. The preliminary injunction was effective immediately through the date on which judgment would be entered on the case. 623 F.Supp.3d 1096.\n\nIn September 2022, the Legislature and Idaho moved for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction. The court subsequently stayed issuance of a decision until the resolution of this motion.\u00a0In the interim, on October 4, 2022, the Legislature renewed its motion to intervene. On February 3, 2023, the court denied the Legislature's motion, holding that the Legislature and the State's interests overlapped fully such that the State would adequately represent the Legislature's interests. 2023 WL 1767387. On March 2, the Legislature appealed to the Ninth Circuit (23-35153).\n\nWhile the Legislature's appeal was pending, the lower court denied the State's motion for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction on May 4, 2023.\u00a0 The court considered the Idaho Supreme Court's January 2023 upholding of \u00a7 18-622 under the Idaho Constitution in Planned Parenthood Great Northwest v. State of [../../../../case/43579/] Idaho [../../../../case/43579/] [../../../../case/43579/], but concluded that the\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0decision did not negate the fundamental principles underpinning this court's preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction in this case did not rest on whether the abortion ban was consistent with the Idaho Constitution, but rather whether it conflicted with EMTALA. 2023 WL 3284977.\n\nOn June 28, 2023, Idaho appealed the initial order on motion for preliminary injunction and the order on motion for reconsideration to the Ninth Circuit (23-35440). On July 3, the Legislature also appealed the order on motion for reconsideration (23-35450). That same day, the Legislature also moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. On September 28, the Ninth Circuit granted that motion, staying the preliminary injunction pending appeal. It explained that the Idaho law likely did not conflict with EMTALA, that the preliminary injunction directly harmed Idaho's sovereignty, and that the balance of the equities and the public interest favored Idaho's right to enforce its legitimately enacted laws during the pendency of the appeal. 83 F.4th 1130.

    "target": "On August 2, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho to protect what it alleged were rights of patients to access emergency abortion care guaranteed by federal law. The suit challenged Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622, which was set to go into effect on Aug. 25 and to impose a near-total ban on abortion. The complaint sought a declaratory judgment that \u00a7 18-622 conflicted with, and was preempted by, the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd, in situations where an abortion is necessary stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition, and an order permanently enjoining the Idaho law to the extent it conflicted with EMTALA. Idaho passed \u00a7 18-622 after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization [../../../../case/43153/].\n\nAccording to the DOJ complaint, EMTALA requires hospitals that receive federal Medicare funds to provide necessary stabilizing treatment to patients who arrive at their emergency departments while experiencing a medical emergency. When a physician reasonably determines that the necessary stabilizing treatment is an abortion, state law cannot prohibit the provision of that care. The federal statute defines necessary stabilizing treatment to include all treatment needed to ensure that a patient will not have her health placed in serious jeopardy, have her bodily functions seriously impaired, or suffer serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\n\nIdaho's \u00a7 18-622 authorized prosecutors to prosecute a physician merely by showing that an abortion has been performed, without regard to the circumstances. A physician who provides an abortion in Idaho could ultimately avoid criminal liability by establishing as an affirmative defense that \u201cthe abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d But the state law provided no defense for an abortion necessary to protect the health of the pregnant patient.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Barry Lynn Winmill. On August 8, 2022 the DOJ moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to EMTALA-mandated care. That same day the Idaho State Legislature moved to intervene as defendants. Judge Winmill granted in part and denied in part the Legislature\u2019s motion. Judge Winmill found that the Legislature could not intervene as a matter of right, since it did not show it sought to voice a different perspective than Idaho, or that Idaho would not adequately represent the Legislature's interests. However, Judge Winmill allowed the Legislature to intervene for the limited purpose of opposing the DOJ\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. The Legislature's participation was limited to presenting evidence and argument aimed at showing the alleged holes in the factual foundation of the DOJ\u2019s motion. 342 F.R.D. 144.\n\nOn August 17, 2022 Judge Winmill denied the Legislature\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing. Judge Winmill found the declarations on file provided a sufficient basis to make an informed decision and the bulk of the alleged factual dispute was actually a legal dispute: the meaning of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 and its overlap with EMTALA. 2022 WL 3442500.\n\nOn August 24, 2022 Judge Winmill granted the DOJ\u2019s preliminary injunction. Judge Winmill found it was not possible for healthcare workers to simultaneously comply with their obligations under EMTALA and Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622. The state law therefore had to yield to federal law under the Supremacy Clause. Even if it was possible to comply with both laws, Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 stood as a clear obstacle to what Congress was attempting to accomplish with EMTALA. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 would deter physicians from providing abortions in some emergency situations while EMTALA intended to ensure emergency care for patients in Medicare-funded hospitals.\n\nThe injunction restrained Idaho from enforcing Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to medical care required by EMTALA. Idaho was prohibited from initiating any criminal prosecution against, attempting to suspend or revoke the professional license of, or seeking to impose any other form of liability on, any medical provider or hospital based on their performance of conduct that is defined as an \u201cabortion\u201d under Idaho Code \u00a7 18-604(1), but that is necessary to avoid\u00a0(i) \u201cplacing the health of\u201d a pregnant patient \u201cin serious jeopardy\u201d; (ii) a \u201cserious impairment to bodily functions\u201d of the pregnant patient; or (iii) a \u201cserious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part\u201d of the pregnant patient. The preliminary injunction was effective immediately through the date on which judgment would be entered on the case. 623 F.Supp.3d 1096.\n\nIn September 2022, the Legislature and Idaho moved for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction. The court subsequently stayed issuance of a decision until the resolution of this motion.\u00a0In the interim, on October 4, 2022, the Legislature renewed its motion to intervene. On February 3, 2023, the court denied the Legislature's motion, holding that the Legislature and the State's interests overlapped fully such that the State would adequately represent the Legislature's interests. 2023 WL 1767387. On March 2, the Legislature appealed to the Ninth Circuit (23-35153).\n\nWhile the Legislature's appeal was pending, the lower court denied the State's motion for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction on May 4, 2023.\u00a0 The court considered the Idaho Supreme Court's January 2023 upholding of \u00a7 18-622 under the Idaho Constitution in Planned Parenthood Great Northwest v. State of [../../../../case/43579/] Idaho [../../../../case/43579/] [../../../../case/43579/], but concluded that the\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0decision did not negate the fundamental principles underpinning this court's preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction in this case did not rest on whether the abortion ban was consistent with the Idaho Constitution, but rather whether it conflicted with EMTALA. 2023 WL 3284977.\n\nOn June 28, 2023, Idaho appealed the initial order on motion for preliminary injunction and the order on motion for reconsideration to the Ninth Circuit (23-35440). On July 3, the Legislature also appealed the order on motion for reconsideration (23-35450). That same day, the Legislature also moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. On September 28, the Ninth Circuit granted that motion, staying the preliminary injunction pending appeal. It explained that the Idaho law likely did not conflict with EMTALA, that the preliminary injunction directly harmed Idaho's sovereignty, and that the balance of the equities and the public interest favored Idaho's right to enforce its legitimately enacted laws during the pendency of the appeal. 83 F.4th 1130. Separately, the Ninth Circuit also consolidated 23-35440 and 23-35450.\n\nOn September 30, 2023, the United States filed an emergency motion for reconsideration en banc of the stay pending appeal. On October 10, per a vote of the majority of nonrecused active judges, the Ninth Circuit ordered the matter be reheard en banc and vacated the stay. 82 F.4th 1296. On November 13, the Ninth Circuit denied the motion to stay, and therefore allowed the district court's injunction to remain in effect while the appeal was pending. \u00a02023 U.S. App. LEXIS 30135. While the appeals were pending, many states and municipalities submitted amicus briefs to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nOn November 20, 2023, both the Legislature (23-726) and Idaho (23-727) separately applied to the Supreme Court for a stay of the district court's preliminary injunction. On January 3, the Idaho Acting Solicitor General notified the Supreme Court of the Fifth Circuit's recent opinion in\u00a0Texas v. [../../../../case/43404/] Becerra [../../../../case/43404/] [../../../../case/43404/], which upheld a permanent injunction of federal guidance which had advised that EMTALA required abortions to be provided in emergency situations, even in jurisdictions with abortion bans. Two days later, the Supreme Court granted the application for stay, treated the application as a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment, and granted the petition. In response, the Ninth Circuit stayed its proceedings regarding its consideration of the preliminary injunction pending a decision by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in April 2024. On June 27, 2024, however, the Court issued a per curiam opinion, dismissing the case as improvidently granted and vacating the January 5 stay. The preliminary injunction was thus reinstated, and hospitals were able to perform emergency abortions in the state while the litigation continued in the lower courts.\n\nJustice Kagan concurred, joined by Justice Sotomayor (and joined in part by Justice Jackson), stating that \u201cIdaho\u2019s arguments about EMTALA do not justify, and have never justified, either emergency relief or our early consideration of this dispute,\u201d and that dismissing the case would allow the regular course of litigation in the lower courts. Justice Barrett also concurred, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh, because the \u201cshape of the [case]\u201d had \u201csubstantially shifted\u201d since the Court granted cert, and because the parties\u2019 positions had continued to evolve. Justice Jackson concurred in part and dissented in part, agreeing that the stay should have been lifted but asserting that the Court was wrong to dismiss the case as improvidently granted, and even suggesting that the Court used this procedural move to avoid an issue it did not wish to decide. Justice Alito dissented, joined by Justice Thomas and in part by Justice Gorsuch, stating that the Court\u2019s \u201cabout-face is baffling,\u201d because nothing \u201clegally relevant\u201d had occurred to change the circumstances of the case since the Court granted cert. Justice Alito offered an interpretation of EMTALA in his dissent, asserting that it did not require covered hospitals to perform abortions in violation of Idaho state law, but instead required hospitals to protect an \u201cunborn child\u201d from harm.\n\nOn remand, the Ninth Circuit ordered replacement briefing, and it held an en banc oral argument on December 10, 2024.\n\nHowever, after President Trump was inaugurated in January 2025, the Trump Administration switched sides on the issue, and dropped the lawsuit.\u00a0 On March 5, 2025, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal, without prejudice, applicable to all of the DOJ\u2019s claims. The case was thereby dismissed and the injunction dissolved. On March 13, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeals pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulated agreement.\n\nThe case is closed.",

    "target": "On August 2, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho to protect what it alleged were rights of patients to access emergency abortion care guaranteed by federal law. The suit challenged Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622, which was set to go into effect on Aug. 25 and to impose a near-total ban on abortion. The complaint sought a declaratory judgment that \u00a7 18-622 conflicted with, and was preempted by, the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd, in situations where an abortion is necessary stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition, and an order permanently enjoining the Idaho law to the extent it conflicted with EMTALA. Idaho passed \u00a7 18-622 after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization [../../../../case/43153/].\n\nAccording to the DOJ complaint, EMTALA requires hospitals that receive federal Medicare funds to provide necessary stabilizing treatment to patients who arrive at their emergency departments while experiencing a medical emergency. When a physician reasonably determines that the necessary stabilizing treatment is an abortion, state law cannot prohibit the provision of that care. The federal statute defines necessary stabilizing treatment to include all treatment needed to ensure that a patient will not have her health placed in serious jeopardy, have her bodily functions seriously impaired, or suffer serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\n\nIdaho's \u00a7 18-622 authorized prosecutors to prosecute a physician merely by showing that an abortion has been performed, without regard to the circumstances. A physician who provides an abortion in Idaho could ultimately avoid criminal liability by establishing as an affirmative defense that \u201cthe abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d But the state law provided no defense for an abortion necessary to protect the health of the pregnant patient.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Barry Lynn Winmill. On August 8, 2022 the DOJ moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to EMTALA-mandated care. That same day the Idaho State Legislature moved to intervene as defendants. Judge Winmill granted in part and denied in part the Legislature\u2019s motion. Judge Winmill found that the Legislature could not intervene as a matter of right, since it did not show it sought to voice a different perspective than Idaho, or that Idaho would not adequately represent the Legislature's interests. However, Judge Winmill allowed the Legislature to intervene for the limited purpose of opposing the DOJ\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. The Legislature's participation was limited to presenting evidence and argument aimed at showing the alleged holes in the factual foundation of the DOJ\u2019s motion. 342 F.R.D. 144.\n\nOn August 17, 2022 Judge Winmill denied the Legislature\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing. Judge Winmill found the declarations on file provided a sufficient basis to make an informed decision and the bulk of the alleged factual dispute was actually a legal dispute: the meaning of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 and its overlap with EMTALA. 2022 WL 3442500.\n\nOn August 24, 2022 Judge Winmill granted the DOJ\u2019s preliminary injunction. Judge Winmill found it was not possible for healthcare workers to simultaneously comply with their obligations under EMTALA and Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622. The state law therefore had to yield to federal law under the Supremacy Clause. Even if it was possible to comply with both laws, Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 stood as a clear obstacle to what Congress was attempting to accomplish with EMTALA. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 would deter physicians from providing abortions in some emergency situations while EMTALA intended to ensure emergency care for patients in Medicare-funded hospitals.\n\nThe injunction restrained Idaho from enforcing Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to medical care required by EMTALA. Idaho was prohibited from initiating any criminal prosecution against, attempting to suspend or revoke the professional license of, or seeking to impose any other form of liability on, any medical provider or hospital based on their performance of conduct that is defined as an \u201cabortion\u201d under Idaho Code \u00a7 18-604(1), but that is necessary to avoid\u00a0(i) \u201cplacing the health of\u201d a pregnant patient \u201cin serious jeopardy\u201d; (ii) a \u201cserious impairment to bodily functions\u201d of the pregnant patient; or (iii) a \u201cserious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part\u201d of the pregnant patient. The preliminary injunction was effective immediately through the date on which judgment would be entered on the case. 623 F.Supp.3d 1096.\n\nIn September 2022, the Legislature and Idaho moved for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction. The court subsequently stayed issuance of a decision until the resolution of this motion.\u00a0In the interim, on October 4, 2022, the Legislature renewed its motion to intervene. On February 3, 2023, the court denied the Legislature's motion, holding that the Legislature and the State's interests overlapped fully such that the State would adequately represent the Legislature's interests. 2023 WL 1767387. On March 2, the Legislature appealed to the Ninth Circuit (23-35153).\n\nWhile the Legislature's appeal was pending, the lower court denied the State's motion for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction on May 4, 2023.\u00a0 The court considered the Idaho Supreme Court's January 2023 upholding of \u00a7 18-622 under the Idaho Constitution in Planned Parenthood Great Northwest v. State of [../../../../case/43579/] Idaho [../../../../case/43579/] [../../../../case/43579/], but concluded that the\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0decision did not negate the fundamental principles underpinning this court's preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction in this case did not rest on whether the abortion ban was consistent with the Idaho Constitution, but rather whether it conflicted with EMTALA. 2023 WL 3284977.\n\nOn June 28, 2023, Idaho appealed the initial order on motion for preliminary injunction and the order on motion for reconsideration to the Ninth Circuit (23-35440). On July 3, the Legislature also appealed the order on motion for reconsideration (23-35450). That same day, the Legislature also moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. On September 28, the Ninth Circuit granted that motion, staying the preliminary injunction pending appeal. It explained that the Idaho law likely did not conflict with EMTALA, that the preliminary injunction directly harmed Idaho's sovereignty, and that the balance of the equities and the public interest favored Idaho's right to enforce its legitimately enacted laws during the pendency of the appeal. 83 F.4th 1130. Separately, the Ninth Circuit also consolidated 23-35440 and 23-35450.\n\nOn September 30, 2023, the United States filed an emergency motion for reconsideration en banc of the stay pending appeal. On October 10, per a vote of the majority of nonrecused active judges, the Ninth Circuit ordered the matter be reheard en banc and vacated the stay. 82 F.4th 1296. On November 13, the Ninth Circuit denied the motion to stay, and therefore allowed the district court's injunction to remain in effect while the appeal was pending. \u00a02023 U.S. App. LEXIS 30135. While the appeals were pending, many states and municipalities submitted amicus briefs to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nOn November 20, 2023, both the Legislature (23-726) and Idaho (23-727) separately applied to the Supreme Court for a stay of the district court's preliminary injunction. On January 3, the Idaho Acting Solicitor General notified the Supreme Court of the Fifth Circuit's recent opinion in\u00a0Texas v. [../../../../case/43404/] Becerra [../../../../case/43404/] [../../../../case/43404/], which upheld a permanent injunction of federal guidance which had advised that EMTALA required abortions to be provided in emergency situations, even in jurisdictions with abortion bans. Two days later, the Supreme Court granted the application for stay, treated the application as a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment, and granted the petition. In response, the Ninth Circuit stayed its proceedings regarding its consideration of the preliminary injunction pending a decision by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in April 2024. On June 27, 2024, however, the Court issued a per curiam opinion, dismissing the case as improvidently granted and vacating the January 5 stay. The preliminary injunction was thus reinstated, and hospitals were able to perform emergency abortions in the state while the litigation continued in the lower courts.\n\nJustice Kagan concurred, joined by Justice Sotomayor (and joined in part by Justice Jackson), stating that \u201cIdaho\u2019s arguments about EMTALA do not justify, and have never justified, either emergency relief or our early consideration of this dispute,\u201d and that dismissing the case would allow the regular course of litigation in the lower courts. Justice Barrett also concurred, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh, because the \u201cshape of the [case]\u201d had \u201csubstantially shifted\u201d since the Court granted cert, and because the parties\u2019 positions had continued to evolve. Justice Jackson concurred in part and dissented in part, agreeing that the stay should have been lifted but asserting that the Court was wrong to dismiss the case as improvidently granted, and even suggesting that the Court used this procedural move to avoid an issue it did not wish to decide. Justice Alito dissented, joined by Justice Thomas and in part by Justice Gorsuch, stating that the Court\u2019s \u201cabout-face is baffling,\u201d because nothing \u201clegally relevant\u201d had occurred to change the circumstances of the case since the Court granted cert. Justice Alito offered an interpretation of EMTALA in his dissent, asserting that it did not require covered hospitals to perform abortions in violation of Idaho state law, but instead required hospitals to protect an \u201cunborn child\u201d from harm.\n\nOn remand, the Ninth Circuit ordered replacement briefing, and it held an en banc oral argument on December 10, 2024.\n\nHowever, after President Trump was inaugurated in January 2025, the Trump Administration switched sides on the issue, and dropped the lawsuit.\u00a0 On March 5, 2025, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal, without prejudice, applicable to all of the DOJ\u2019s claims. The case was thereby dismissed and the injunction dissolved. On March 13, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeals pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulated agreement.\n\nThe case is closed.",

    "target": "On August 2, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho to protect what it alleged were rights of patients to access emergency abortion care guaranteed by federal law. The suit challenged Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622, which was set to go into effect on Aug. 25 and to impose a near-total ban on abortion. The complaint sought a declaratory judgment that \u00a7 18-622 conflicted with, and was preempted by, the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd, in situations where an abortion is necessary stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition, and an order permanently enjoining the Idaho law to the extent it conflicted with EMTALA. Idaho passed \u00a7 18-622 after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization [../../../../case/43153/].\n\nAccording to the DOJ complaint, EMTALA requires hospitals that receive federal Medicare funds to provide necessary stabilizing treatment to patients who arrive at their emergency departments while experiencing a medical emergency. When a physician reasonably determines that the necessary stabilizing treatment is an abortion, state law cannot prohibit the provision of that care. The federal statute defines necessary stabilizing treatment to include all treatment needed to ensure that a patient will not have her health placed in serious jeopardy, have her bodily functions seriously impaired, or suffer serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\n\nIdaho's \u00a7 18-622 authorized prosecutors to prosecute a physician merely by showing that an abortion has been performed, without regard to the circumstances. A physician who provides an abortion in Idaho could ultimately avoid criminal liability by establishing as an affirmative defense that \u201cthe abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d But the state law provided no defense for an abortion necessary to protect the health of the pregnant patient.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Barry Lynn Winmill. On August 8, 2022 the DOJ moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to EMTALA-mandated care. That same day the Idaho State Legislature moved to intervene as defendants. Judge Winmill granted in part and denied in part the Legislature\u2019s motion. Judge Winmill found that the Legislature could not intervene as a matter of right, since it did not show it sought to voice a different perspective than Idaho, or that Idaho would not adequately represent the Legislature's interests. However, Judge Winmill allowed the Legislature to intervene for the limited purpose of opposing the DOJ\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. The Legislature's participation was limited to presenting evidence and argument aimed at showing the alleged holes in the factual foundation of the DOJ\u2019s motion. 342 F.R.D. 144.\n\nOn August 17, 2022 Judge Winmill denied the Legislature\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing. Judge Winmill found the declarations on file provided a sufficient basis to make an informed decision and the bulk of the alleged factual dispute was actually a legal dispute: the meaning of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 and its overlap with EMTALA. 2022 WL 3442500.\n\nOn August 24, 2022 Judge Winmill granted the DOJ\u2019s preliminary injunction. Judge Winmill found it was not possible for healthcare workers to simultaneously comply with their obligations under EMTALA and Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622. The state law therefore had to yield to federal law under the Supremacy Clause. Even if it was possible to comply with both laws, Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 stood as a clear obstacle to what Congress was attempting to accomplish with EMTALA. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 would deter physicians from providing abortions in some emergency situations while EMTALA intended to ensure emergency care for patients in Medicare-funded hospitals.\n\nThe injunction restrained Idaho from enforcing Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to medical care required by EMTALA. Idaho was prohibited from initiating any criminal prosecution against, attempting to suspend or revoke the professional license of, or seeking to impose any other form of liability on, any medical provider or hospital based on their performance of conduct that is defined as an \u201cabortion\u201d under Idaho Code \u00a7 18-604(1), but that is necessary to avoid\u00a0(i) \u201cplacing the health of\u201d a pregnant patient \u201cin serious jeopardy\u201d; (ii) a \u201cserious impairment to bodily functions\u201d of the pregnant patient; or (iii) a \u201cserious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part\u201d of the pregnant patient. The preliminary injunction was effective immediately through the date on which judgment would be entered on the case. 623 F.Supp.3d 1096.\n\nIn September 2022, the Legislature and Idaho moved for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction. The court subsequently stayed issuance of a decision until the resolution of this motion.\u00a0In the interim, on October 4, 2022, the Legislature renewed its motion to intervene. On February 3, 2023, the court denied the Legislature's motion, holding that the Legislature and the State's interests overlapped fully such that the State would adequately represent the Legislature's interests. 2023 WL 1767387. On March 2, the Legislature appealed to the Ninth Circuit (23-35153).\n\nWhile the Legislature's appeal was pending, the lower court denied the State's motion for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction on May 4, 2023.\u00a0 The court considered the Idaho Supreme Court's January 2023 upholding of \u00a7 18-622 under the Idaho Constitution in Planned Parenthood Great Northwest v. State of [../../../../case/43579/] Idaho [../../../../case/43579/] [../../../../case/43579/], but concluded that the\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0decision did not negate the fundamental principles underpinning this court's preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction in this case did not rest on whether the abortion ban was consistent with the Idaho Constitution, but rather whether it conflicted with EMTALA. 2023 WL 3284977.\n\nOn June 28, 2023, Idaho appealed the initial order on motion for preliminary injunction and the order on motion for reconsideration to the Ninth Circuit (23-35440). On July 3, the Legislature also appealed the order on motion for reconsideration (23-35450). That same day, the Legislature also moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. On September 28, the Ninth Circuit granted that motion, staying the preliminary injunction pending appeal. It explained that the Idaho law likely did not conflict with EMTALA, that the preliminary injunction directly harmed Idaho's sovereignty, and that the balance of the equities and the public interest favored Idaho's right to enforce its legitimately enacted laws during the pendency of the appeal. 83 F.4th 1130. Separately, the Ninth Circuit also consolidated 23-35440 and 23-35450.\n\nOn September 30, 2023, the United States filed an emergency motion for reconsideration en banc of the stay pending appeal. On October 10, per a vote of the majority of nonrecused active judges, the Ninth Circuit ordered the matter be reheard en banc and vacated the stay. 82 F.4th 1296. On November 13, the Ninth Circuit denied the motion to stay, and therefore allowed the district court's injunction to remain in effect while the appeal was pending. \u00a02023 U.S. App. LEXIS 30135. While the appeals were pending, many states and municipalities submitted amicus briefs to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nOn November 20, 2023, both the Legislature (23-726) and Idaho (23-727) separately applied to the Supreme Court for a stay of the district court's preliminary injunction. On January 3, the Idaho Acting Solicitor General notified the Supreme Court of the Fifth Circuit's recent opinion in\u00a0Texas v. [../../../../case/43404/] Becerra [../../../../case/43404/] [../../../../case/43404/], which upheld a permanent injunction of federal guidance which had advised that EMTALA required abortions to be provided in emergency situations, even in jurisdictions with abortion bans. Two days later, the Supreme Court granted the application for stay, treated the application as a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment, and granted the petition. In response, the Ninth Circuit stayed its proceedings regarding its consideration of the preliminary injunction pending a decision by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in April 2024. On June 27, 2024, however, the Court issued a per curiam opinion, dismissing the case as improvidently granted and vacating the January 5 stay. The preliminary injunction was thus reinstated, and hospitals were able to perform emergency abortions in the state while the litigation continued in the lower courts.\n\nJustice Kagan concurred, joined by Justice Sotomayor (and joined in part by Justice Jackson), stating that \u201cIdaho\u2019s arguments about EMTALA do not justify, and have never justified, either emergency relief or our early consideration of this dispute,\u201d and that dismissing the case would allow the regular course of litigation in the lower courts. Justice Barrett also concurred, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh, because the \u201cshape of the [case]\u201d had \u201csubstantially shifted\u201d since the Court granted cert, and because the parties\u2019 positions had continued to evolve. Justice Jackson concurred in part and dissented in part, agreeing that the stay should have been lifted but asserting that the Court was wrong to dismiss the case as improvidently granted, and even suggesting that the Court used this procedural move to avoid an issue it did not wish to decide. Justice Alito dissented, joined by Justice Thomas and in part by Justice Gorsuch, stating that the Court\u2019s \u201cabout-face is baffling,\u201d because nothing \u201clegally relevant\u201d had occurred to change the circumstances of the case since the Court granted cert. Justice Alito offered an interpretation of EMTALA in his dissent, asserting that it did not require covered hospitals to perform abortions in violation of Idaho state law, but instead required hospitals to protect an \u201cunborn child\u201d from harm.\n\nOn remand, the Ninth Circuit ordered replacement briefing, and it held an en banc oral argument on December 10, 2024.\n\nHowever, after President Trump was inaugurated in January 2025, the Trump Administration switched sides on the issue, and dropped the lawsuit.\u00a0 On March 5, 2025, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal, without prejudice, applicable to all of the DOJ\u2019s claims. The case was thereby dismissed and the injunction dissolved. On March 13, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeals pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulated agreement.\n\nThe case is closed.",

Idaho passed \u00a7 18-622 after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization [../../../../case/43153/].\n\nAccording to the DOJ complaint, EMTALA requires hospitals that receive federal Medicare funds to provide necessary stabilizing treatment to patients who arrive at their emergency departments while experiencing a medical emergency. When a physician reasonably determines that the necessary stabilizing treatment is an abortion, state law cannot prohibit the provision of that care. The federal statute defines necessary stabilizing treatment to include all treatment needed to ensure that a patient will not have her health placed in serious jeopardy, have her bodily functions seriously impaired, or suffer serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\n\nIdaho's \u00a7 18-622 authorized prosecutors to prosecute a physician merely by showing that an abortion has been performed, without regard to the circumstances. A physician who provides an abortion in Idaho could ultimately avoid criminal liability by establishing as an affirmative defense that \u201cthe abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d But the state law provided no defense for an abortion necessary to protect the health of the pregnant patient.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Barry Lynn Winmill. On August 8, 2022 the DOJ moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to EMTALA-mandated care. That same day the Idaho State Legislature moved to intervene as defendants. Judge Winmill granted in part and denied in part the Legislature\u2019s motion. Judge Winmill found that the Legislature could not intervene as a matter of right, since it did not show it sought to voice a different perspective than Idaho, or that Idaho would not adequately represent the Legislature's interests. However, Judge Winmill allowed the Legislature to intervene for the limited purpose of opposing the DOJ\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. The Legislature's participation was limited to presenting evidence and argument aimed at showing the alleged holes in the factual foundation of the DOJ\u2019s motion. 342 F.R.D. 144.\n\nOn August 17, 2022 Judge Winmill denied the Legislature\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing. Judge Winmill found the declarations on file provided a sufficient basis to make an informed decision and the bulk of the alleged factual dispute was actually a legal dispute: the meaning of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 and its overlap with EMTALA. 2022 WL 3442500.\n\nOn August 24, 2022 Judge Winmill granted the DOJ\u2019s preliminary injunction. Judge Winmill found it was not possible for healthcare workers to simultaneously comply with their obligations under EMTALA and Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622. The state law therefore had to yield to federal law under the Supremacy Clause. Even if it was possible to comply with both laws, Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 stood as a clear obstacle to what Congress was attempting to accomplish with EMTALA. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 would deter physicians from providing abortions in some emergency situations while EMTALA intended to ensure emergency care for patients in Medicare-funded hospitals.\n\nThe injunction restrained Idaho from enforcing Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to medical care required by EMTALA. Idaho was prohibited from initiating any criminal prosecution against, attempting to suspend or revoke the professional license of, or seeking to impose any other form of liability on, any medical provider or hospital based on their performance of conduct that is defined as an \u201cabortion\u201d under Idaho Code \u00a7 18-604(1), but that is necessary to avoid\u00a0(i) \u201cplacing the health of\u201d a pregnant patient \u201cin serious jeopardy\u201d; (ii) a \u201cserious impairment to bodily functions\u201d of the pregnant patient; or (iii) a \u201cserious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part\u201d of the pregnant patient. The preliminary injunction was effective immediately through the date on which judgment would be entered on the case. 623 F.Supp.3d 1096.\n\nIn September 2022, the Legislature and Idaho moved for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction. The court subsequently stayed issuance of a decision until the resolution of this motion.\u00a0In the interim, on October 4, 2022, the Legislature renewed its motion to intervene. On February 3, 2023, the court denied the Legislature's motion, holding that the Legislature and the State's interests overlapped fully such that the State would adequately represent the Legislature's interests. 2023 WL 1767387. On March 2, the Legislature appealed to the Ninth Circuit (23-35153).\n\nWhile the Legislature's appeal was pending, the lower court denied the State's motion for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction on May 4, 2023.\u00a0 The court considered the Idaho Supreme Court's January 2023 upholding of \u00a7 18-622 under the Idaho Constitution in Planned Parenthood Great Northwest v. State of [../../../../case/43579/] Idaho [../../../../case/43579/] [../../../../case/43579/], but concluded that the\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0decision did not negate the fundamental principles underpinning this court's preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction in this case did not rest on whether the abortion ban was consistent with the Idaho Constitution, but rather whether it conflicted with EMTALA. 2023 WL 3284977.\n\nOn June 28, 2023, Idaho appealed the initial order on motion for preliminary injunction and the order on motion for reconsideration to the Ninth Circuit (23-35440). On July 3, the Legislature also appealed the order on motion for reconsideration (23-35450). That same day, the Legislature also moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. On September 28, the Ninth Circuit granted that motion, staying the preliminary injunction pending appeal. It explained that the Idaho law likely did not conflict with EMTALA, that the preliminary injunction directly harmed Idaho's sovereignty, and that the balance of the equities and the public interest favored Idaho's right to enforce its legitimately enacted laws during the pendency of the appeal. 83 F.4th 1130. Separately, the Ninth Circuit also consolidated 23-35440 and 23-35450.\n\nOn September 30, 2023, the United States filed an emergency motion for reconsideration en banc of the stay pending appeal. On October 10, per a vote of the majority of nonrecused active judges, the Ninth Circuit ordered the matter be reheard en banc and vacated the stay. 82 F.4th 1296. On November 13, the Ninth Circuit denied the motion to stay, and therefore allowed the district court's injunction to remain in effect while the appeal was pending. \u00a02023 U.S. App. LEXIS 30135. While the appeals were pending, many states and municipalities submitted amicus briefs to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nOn November 20, 2023, both the Legislature (23-726) and Idaho (23-727) separately applied to the Supreme Court for a stay of the district court's preliminary injunction. On January 3, the Idaho Acting Solicitor General notified the Supreme Court of the Fifth Circuit's recent opinion in\u00a0Texas v. [../../../../case/43404/] Becerra [../../../../case/43404/] [../../../../case/43404/], which upheld a permanent injunction of federal guidance which had advised that EMTALA required abortions to be provided in emergency situations, even in jurisdictions with abortion bans. Two days later, the Supreme Court granted the application for stay, treated the application as a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment, and granted the petition. In response, the Ninth Circuit stayed its proceedings regarding its consideration of the preliminary injunction pending a decision by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in April 2024. On June 27, 2024, however, the Court issued a per curiam opinion, dismissing the case as improvidently granted and vacating the January 5 stay. The preliminary injunction was thus reinstated, and hospitals were able to perform emergency abortions in the state while the litigation continued in the lower courts.\n\nJustice Kagan concurred, joined by Justice Sotomayor (and joined in part by Justice Jackson), stating that \u201cIdaho\u2019s arguments about EMTALA do not justify, and have never justified, either emergency relief or our early consideration of this dispute,\u201d and that dismissing the case would allow the regular course of litigation in the lower courts. Justice Barrett also concurred, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh, because the \u201cshape of the [case]\u201d had \u201csubstantially shifted\u201d since the Court granted cert, and because the parties\u2019 positions had continued to evolve. Justice Jackson concurred in part and dissented in part, agreeing that the stay should have been lifted but asserting that the Court was wrong to dismiss the case as improvidently granted, and even suggesting that the Court used this procedural move to avoid an issue it did not wish to decide. Justice Alito dissented, joined by Justice Thomas and in part by Justice Gorsuch, stating that the Court\u2019s \u201cabout-face is baffling,\u201d because nothing \u201clegally relevant\u201d had occurred to change the circumstances of the case since the Court granted cert. Justice Alito offered an interpretation of EMTALA in his dissent, asserting that it did not require covered hospitals to perform abortions in violation of Idaho state law, but instead required hospitals to protect an \u201cunborn child\u201d from harm.\n\nOn remand, the Ninth Circuit ordered replacement briefing, and it held an en banc oral argument on December 10, 2024.\n\nHowever, after President Trump was inaugurated in January 2025, the Trump Administration switched sides on the issue, and dropped the lawsuit.\u00a0 On March 5, 2025, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal, without prejudice, applicable to all of the DOJ\u2019s claims. The case was thereby dismissed and the injunction dissolved. On March 13, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeals pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulated agreement.\n\nThe case is closed.",

On August 8, 2022 the DOJ moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to EMTALA-mandated care. That same day the Idaho State Legislature moved to intervene as defendants. Judge Winmill granted in part and denied in part the Legislature\u2019s motion. Judge Winmill found that the Legislature could not intervene as a matter of right, since it did not show it sought to voice a different perspective than Idaho, or that Idaho would not adequately represent the Legislature's interests. However, Judge Winmill allowed the Legislature to intervene for the limited purpose of opposing the DOJ\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. The Legislature's participation was limited to presenting evidence and argument aimed at showing the alleged holes in the factual foundation of the DOJ\u2019s motion. 342 F.R.D. 144.\n\nOn August 17, 2022 Judge Winmill denied the Legislature\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing. Judge Winmill found the declarations on file provided a sufficient basis to make an informed decision and the bulk of the alleged factual dispute was actually a legal dispute: the meaning of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 and its overlap with EMTALA. 2022 WL 3442500.\n\nOn August 24, 2022 Judge Winmill granted the DOJ\u2019s preliminary injunction. Judge Winmill found it was not possible for healthcare workers to simultaneously comply with their obligations under EMTALA and Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622. The state law therefore had to yield to federal law under the Supremacy Clause. Even if it was possible to comply with both laws, Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 stood as a clear obstacle to what Congress was attempting to accomplish with EMTALA. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 would deter physicians from providing abortions in some emergency situations while EMTALA intended to ensure emergency care for patients in Medicare-funded hospitals.\n\nThe injunction restrained Idaho from enforcing Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to medical care required by EMTALA. Idaho was prohibited from initiating any criminal prosecution against, attempting to suspend or revoke the professional license of, or seeking to impose any other form of liability on, any medical provider or hospital based on their performance of conduct that is defined as an \u201cabortion\u201d under Idaho Code \u00a7 18-604(1), but that is necessary to avoid\u00a0(i) \u201cplacing the health of\u201d a pregnant patient \u201cin serious jeopardy\u201d; (ii) a \u201cserious impairment to bodily functions\u201d of the pregnant patient; or (iii) a \u201cserious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part\u201d of the pregnant patient. The preliminary injunction was effective immediately through the date on which judgment would be entered on the case. 623 F.Supp.3d 1096.\n\nIn September 2022, the Legislature and Idaho moved for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction. The court subsequently stayed issuance of a decision until the resolution of this motion.\u00a0In the interim, on October 4, 2022, the Legislature renewed its motion to intervene. On February 3, 2023, the court denied the Legislature's motion, holding that the Legislature and the State's interests overlapped fully such that the State would adequately represent the Legislature's interests. 2023 WL 1767387. On March 2, the Legislature appealed to the Ninth Circuit (23-35153).\n\nWhile the Legislature's appeal was pending, the lower court denied the State's motion for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction on May 4, 2023.\u00a0 The court considered the Idaho Supreme Court's January 2023 upholding of \u00a7 18-622 under the Idaho Constitution in Planned Parenthood Great Northwest v. State of [../../../../case/43579/] Idaho [../../../../case/43579/] [../../../../case/43579/], but concluded that the\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0decision did not negate the fundamental principles underpinning this court's preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction in this case did not rest on whether the abortion ban was consistent with the Idaho Constitution, but rather whether it conflicted with EMTALA. 2023 WL 3284977.\n\nOn June 28, 2023, Idaho appealed the initial order on motion for preliminary injunction and the order on motion for reconsideration to the Ninth Circuit (23-35440). On July 3, the Legislature also appealed the order on motion for reconsideration (23-35450). That same day, the Legislature also moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. On September 28, the Ninth Circuit granted that motion, staying the preliminary injunction pending appeal. It explained that the Idaho law likely did not conflict with EMTALA, that the preliminary injunction directly harmed Idaho's sovereignty, and that the balance of the equities and the public interest favored Idaho's right to enforce its legitimately enacted laws during the pendency of the appeal. 83 F.4th 1130. Separately, the Ninth Circuit also consolidated 23-35440 and 23-35450.\n\nOn September 30, 2023, the United States filed an emergency motion for reconsideration en banc of the stay pending appeal. On October 10, per a vote of the majority of nonrecused active judges, the Ninth Circuit ordered the matter be reheard en banc and vacated the stay. 82 F.4th 1296. On November 13, the Ninth Circuit denied the motion to stay, and therefore allowed the district court's injunction to remain in effect while the appeal was pending. \u00a02023 U.S. App. LEXIS 30135. While the appeals were pending, many states and municipalities submitted amicus briefs to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nOn November 20, 2023, both the Legislature (23-726) and Idaho (23-727) separately applied to the Supreme Court for a stay of the district court's preliminary injunction. On January 3, the Idaho Acting Solicitor General notified the Supreme Court of the Fifth Circuit's recent opinion in\u00a0Texas v. [../../../../case/43404/] Becerra [../../../../case/43404/] [../../../../case/43404/], which upheld a permanent injunction of federal guidance which had advised that EMTALA required abortions to be provided in emergency situations, even in jurisdictions with abortion bans. Two days later, the Supreme Court granted the application for stay, treated the application as a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment, and granted the petition. In response, the Ninth Circuit stayed its proceedings regarding its consideration of the preliminary injunction pending a decision by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in April 2024. On June 27, 2024, however, the Court issued a per curiam opinion, dismissing the case as improvidently granted and vacating the January 5 stay. The preliminary injunction was thus reinstated, and hospitals were able to perform emergency abortions in the state while the litigation continued in the lower courts.\n\nJustice Kagan concurred, joined by Justice Sotomayor (and joined in part by Justice Jackson), stating that \u201cIdaho\u2019s arguments about EMTALA do not justify, and have never justified, either emergency relief or our early consideration of this dispute,\u201d and that dismissing the case would allow the regular course of litigation in the lower courts. Justice Barrett also concurred, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh, because the \u201cshape of the [case]\u201d had \u201csubstantially shifted\u201d since the Court granted cert, and because the parties\u2019 positions had continued to evolve. Justice Jackson concurred in part and dissented in part, agreeing that the stay should have been lifted but asserting that the Court was wrong to dismiss the case as improvidently granted, and even suggesting that the Court used this procedural move to avoid an issue it did not wish to decide. Justice Alito dissented, joined by Justice Thomas and in part by Justice Gorsuch, stating that the Court\u2019s \u201cabout-face is baffling,\u201d because nothing \u201clegally relevant\u201d had occurred to change the circumstances of the case since the Court granted cert. Justice Alito offered an interpretation of EMTALA in his dissent, asserting that it did not require covered hospitals to perform abortions in violation of Idaho state law, but instead required hospitals to protect an \u201cunborn child\u201d from harm.\n\nOn remand, the Ninth Circuit ordered replacement briefing, and it held an en banc oral argument on December 10, 2024.\n\nHowever, after President Trump was inaugurated in January 2025, the Trump Administration switched sides on the issue, and dropped the lawsuit.\u00a0 On March 5, 2025, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal, without prejudice, applicable to all of the DOJ\u2019s claims. The case was thereby dismissed and the injunction dissolved. On March 13, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeals pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulated agreement.\n\nThe case is closed.",

    "target": "On August 2, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho to protect what it alleged were rights of patients to access emergency abortion care guaranteed by federal law. The suit challenged Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622, which was set to go into effect on Aug. 25 and to impose a near-total ban on abortion. The complaint sought a declaratory judgment that \u00a7 18-622 conflicted with, and was preempted by, the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd, in situations where an abortion is necessary stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition, and an order permanently enjoining the Idaho law to the extent it conflicted with EMTALA. Idaho passed \u00a7 18-622 after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization [../../../../case/43153/].\n\nAccording to the DOJ complaint, EMTALA requires hospitals that receive federal Medicare funds to provide necessary stabilizing treatment to patients who arrive at their emergency departments while experiencing a medical emergency. When a physician reasonably determines that the necessary stabilizing treatment is an abortion, state law cannot prohibit the provision of that care. The federal statute defines necessary stabilizing treatment to include all treatment needed to ensure that a patient will not have her health placed in serious jeopardy, have her bodily functions seriously impaired, or suffer serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\n\nIdaho's \u00a7 18-622 authorized prosecutors to prosecute a physician merely by showing that an abortion has been performed, without regard to the circumstances.

    "target": "On August 2, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho to protect what it alleged were rights of patients to access emergency abortion care guaranteed by federal law. The suit challenged Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622, which was set to go into effect on Aug. 25 and to impose a near-total ban on abortion. The complaint sought a declaratory judgment that \u00a7 18-622 conflicted with, and was preempted by, the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd, in situations where an abortion is necessary stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition, and an order permanently enjoining the Idaho law to the extent it conflicted with EMTALA. Idaho passed \u00a7 18-622 after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization [../../../../case/43153/].\n\nAccording to the DOJ complaint, EMTALA requires hospitals that receive federal Medicare funds to provide necessary stabilizing treatment to patients who arrive at their emergency departments while experiencing a medical emergency. When a physician reasonably determines that the necessary stabilizing treatment is an abortion, state law cannot prohibit the provision of that care. The federal statute defines necessary stabilizing treatment to include all treatment needed to ensure that a patient will not have her health placed in serious jeopardy, have her bodily functions seriously impaired, or suffer serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\n\nIdaho's \u00a7 18-622 authorized prosecutors to prosecute a physician merely by showing that an abortion has been performed, without regard to the circumstances. A physician who provides an abortion in Idaho could ultimately avoid criminal liability by establishing as an affirmative defense that \u201cthe abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d But the state law provided no defense for an abortion necessary to protect the health of the pregnant patient.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Barry Lynn Winmill. On August 8, 2022 the DOJ moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to EMTALA-mandated care. That same day the Idaho State Legislature moved to intervene as defendants. Judge Winmill granted in part and denied in part the Legislature\u2019s motion. Judge Winmill found that the Legislature could not intervene as a matter of right, since it did not show it sought to voice a different perspective than Idaho, or that Idaho would not adequately represent the Legislature's interests. However, Judge Winmill allowed the Legislature to intervene for the limited purpose of opposing the DOJ\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. The Legislature's participation was limited to presenting evidence and argument aimed at showing the alleged holes in the factual foundation of the DOJ\u2019s motion. 342 F.R.D. 144.\n\nOn August 17, 2022 Judge Winmill denied the Legislature\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing. Judge Winmill found the declarations on file provided a sufficient basis to make an informed decision and the bulk of the alleged factual dispute was actually a legal dispute: the meaning of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 and its overlap with EMTALA. 2022 WL 3442500.\n\nOn August 24, 2022 Judge Winmill granted the DOJ\u2019s preliminary injunction. Judge Winmill found it was not possible for healthcare workers to simultaneously comply with their obligations under EMTALA and Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622. The state law therefore had to yield to federal law under the Supremacy Clause. Even if it was possible to comply with both laws, Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 stood as a clear obstacle to what Congress was attempting to accomplish with EMTALA. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 would deter physicians from providing abortions in some emergency situations while EMTALA intended to ensure emergency care for patients in Medicare-funded hospitals.\n\nThe injunction restrained Idaho from enforcing Idaho Code \u00a7 18-622 as applied to medical care required by EMTALA. Idaho was prohibited from initiating any criminal prosecution against, attempting to suspend or revoke the professional license of, or seeking to impose any other form of liability on, any medical provider or hospital based on their performance of conduct that is defined as an \u201cabortion\u201d under Idaho Code \u00a7 18-604(1), but that is necessary to avoid\u00a0(i) \u201cplacing the health of\u201d a pregnant patient \u201cin serious jeopardy\u201d; (ii) a \u201cserious impairment to bodily functions\u201d of the pregnant patient; or (iii) a \u201cserious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part\u201d of the pregnant patient. The preliminary injunction was effective immediately through the date on which judgment would be entered on the case. 623 F.Supp.3d 1096.\n\nIn September 2022, the Legislature and Idaho moved for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction. The court subsequently stayed issuance of a decision until the resolution of this motion.\u00a0In the interim, on October 4, 2022, the Legislature renewed its motion to intervene. On February 3, 2023, the court denied the Legislature's motion, holding that the Legislature and the State's interests overlapped fully such that the State would adequately represent the Legislature's interests. 2023 WL 1767387. On March 2, the Legislature appealed to the Ninth Circuit (23-35153).\n\nWhile the Legislature's appeal was pending, the lower court denied the State's motion for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction on May 4, 2023.\u00a0 The court considered the Idaho Supreme Court's January 2023 upholding of \u00a7 18-622 under the Idaho Constitution in Planned Parenthood Great Northwest v. State of [../../../../case/43579/] Idaho [../../../../case/43579/] [../../../../case/43579/], but concluded that the\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0decision did not negate the fundamental principles underpinning this court's preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction in this case did not rest on whether the abortion ban was consistent with the Idaho Constitution, but rather whether it conflicted with EMTALA. 2023 WL 3284977.\n\nOn June 28, 2023, Idaho appealed the initial order on motion for preliminary injunction and the order on motion for reconsideration to the Ninth Circuit (23-35440). On July 3, the Legislature also appealed the order on motion for reconsideration (23-35450). That same day, the Legislature also moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. On September 28, the Ninth Circuit granted that motion, staying the preliminary injunction pending appeal. It explained that the Idaho law likely did not conflict with EMTALA, that the preliminary injunction directly harmed Idaho's sovereignty, and that the balance of the equities and the public interest favored Idaho's right to enforce its legitimately enacted laws during the pendency of the appeal. 83 F.4th 1130. Separately, the Ninth Circuit also consolidated 23-35440 and 23-35450.\n\nOn September 30, 2023, the United States filed an emergency motion for reconsideration en banc of the stay pending appeal. On October 10, per a vote of the majority of nonrecused active judges, the Ninth Circuit ordered the matter be reheard en banc and vacated the stay. 82 F.4th 1296. On November 13, the Ninth Circuit denied the motion to stay, and therefore allowed the district court's injunction to remain in effect while the appeal was pending. \u00a02023 U.S. App. LEXIS 30135. While the appeals were pending, many states and municipalities submitted amicus briefs to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nOn November 20, 2023, both the Legislature (23-726) and Idaho (23-727) separately applied to the Supreme Court for a stay of the district court's preliminary injunction. On January 3, the Idaho Acting Solicitor General notified the Supreme Court of the Fifth Circuit's recent opinion in\u00a0Texas v. [../../../../case/43404/] Becerra [../../../../case/43404/] [../../../../case/43404/], which upheld a permanent injunction of federal guidance which had advised that EMTALA required abortions to be provided in emergency situations, even in jurisdictions with abortion bans. Two days later, the Supreme Court granted the application for stay, treated the application as a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment, and granted the petition. In response, the Ninth Circuit stayed its proceedings regarding its consideration of the preliminary injunction pending a decision by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in April 2024. On June 27, 2024, however, the Court issued a per curiam opinion, dismissing the case as improvidently granted and vacating the January 5 stay. The preliminary injunction was thus reinstated, and hospitals were able to perform emergency abortions in the state while the litigation continued in the lower courts.\n\nJustice Kagan concurred, joined by Justice Sotomayor (and joined in part by Justice Jackson), stating that \u201cIdaho\u2019s arguments about EMTALA do not justify, and have never justified, either emergency relief or our early consideration of this dispute,\u201d and that dismissing the case would allow the regular course of litigation in the lower courts. Justice Barrett also concurred, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh, because the \u201cshape of the [case]\u201d had \u201csubstantially shifted\u201d since the Court granted cert, and because the parties\u2019 positions had continued to evolve. Justice Jackson concurred in part and dissented in part, agreeing that the stay should have been lifted but asserting that the Court was wrong to dismiss the case as improvidently granted, and even suggesting that the Court used this procedural move to avoid an issue it did not wish to decide. Justice Alito dissented, joined by Justice Thomas and in part by Justice Gorsuch, stating that the Court\u2019s \u201cabout-face is baffling,\u201d because nothing \u201clegally relevant\u201d had occurred to change the circumstances of the case since the Court granted cert. Justice Alito offered an interpretation of EMTALA in his dissent, asserting that it did not require covered hospitals to perform abortions in violation of Idaho state law, but instead required hospitals to protect an \u201cunborn child\u201d from harm.\n\nOn remand, the Ninth Circuit ordered replacement briefing, and it held an en banc oral argument on December 10, 2024.\n\nHowever, after President Trump was inaugurated in January 2025, the Trump Administration switched sides on the issue, and dropped the lawsuit.\u00a0 On March 5, 2025, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal, without prejudice, applicable to all of the DOJ\u2019s claims. The case was thereby dismissed and the injunction dissolved. On March 13, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeals pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulated agreement.\n\nThe case is closed.",
