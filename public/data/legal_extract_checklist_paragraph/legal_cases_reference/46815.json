Upon arrival, they were sent to the country\u2019s mega-prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center or CECOT.\n\nThe defendant in this case, Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, is a Salvadoran national residing in the United States who had previously received protection from removal from an immigration judge. Despite this order withholding his removal, Abrego-Garcia was deported due to what the U.S. government termed an \"administrative error.\"\u00a0 On March 24, 2025, Abrego-Garcia filed a habeas petition in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (8:25-cv-00951). It may be useful to read about that habeas case [../../../../case/46283/] before reading the summary of this one; throughout this case summary, we refer to that lawsuit as the habeas case or habeas court. On April 4, 2025, the habeas court ordered the government to facilitate Abrego-Garcia's return to the United States.\n\nOn June 6, 2025 the government informed the habeas court that it had \"successfully facilitated Abrego-Garcia\u2019s return,\" and that he would stand trial on criminal charges in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The government filed a human smuggling indictment against Abrego-Garcia; press reports [https://abcnews.go.com/US/mistakenly-deported-kilmar-abrego-garcia-back-us-face/story?id=121333122] said that disagreement with how the prosecution was being handled prompted the criminal section chief's resignation in the U.S. Attorney's office that brought the case. The indictment charged Abrego-Garcia with one count of conspiracy to transport undocumented individuals and one count of unlawful transportation of undocumented individuals. Abrego-Garcia made his initial court appearance that same day in the Middle District of Tennessee before U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, the government requested a pretrial detention hearing. The court granted the request, but the judge ultimately denied the government\u2019s motion to detain Abrego-Garcia. The government moved to stay that decision on June 22, 2025, but the motion was also denied. In her opinion denying the stay, Judge Crenshaw found that the government had not made a \u201cstrong showing\u201d that the four stay factors weighed in the government's favor.\n\nAbrego-Garcia remained in custody as the government and his attorneys submitted statements regarding potential release conditions. On July 2, the government moved for the court to revoke the magistrate judge's release order. The government made separate statements that once Abrego-Garcia is released from criminal custody, it will take him into immigration custody and again remove him to El Salvador.\n\nIn response, Abrego-Garciamoved for the court to delay his release until the July 16 hearing on the government's motion for revocation. Abrego-Garciaalleged that this would be the only way to ensure that the government does not remove him to a '\"third country\" as soon as the Court released Abrego-Garciafrom pretrial detention. The court granted this motion on June 30, 2025. On July 20, Abrego-Garciamoved, with the government's consent, for a 30-day stay of the issuance of any release order. Abrego-Garciaclaimed he had been \"advised by the government that if the Court denies the government's motion for revocation, the defendant would be transferred to the custody of [DHS], and DHS would begin removal proceedings.\"\n\nIn response, Abrego-Garcia moved for emergency relief in the District Court of Maryland on June 26, 2025. Abrego-Garcia requested the court order the government to:\n\n\u2022 Return him to Maryland immediately upon his release from confinement in Tennessee.   \u2022 Refrain from removing him from the United States or from transferring him outside the District of Maryland.\n\nOn July 24, Judge Xinis prohibited the administration from re-arresting Abrego-Garcia upon his release in Tennessee. Judge Crenshaw denied the administration\u2019s motion to revoke the release order for Kilmar Abrego-Garcia from criminal detention, noting the administration failed to justify continued pretrial detention. Later that day, Magistrate Judge Holmes granted a 30-day stay of the order, keeping Garcia in U.S. Marshal custody.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, Abrego-Garcia waived his right to a speedy trial and consent to a continuance of up to 127 days. Following this waiver, on August 19, Abrego-Garcia moved the court to dismiss for vindictive and selective prosecution. In the alternative, the defendant requested discovery and an evidentiary hearing to investigate his claims.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

The government filed a human smuggling indictment against Abrego-Garcia; press reports [https://abcnews.go.com/US/mistakenly-deported-kilmar-abrego-garcia-back-us-face/story?id=121333122] said that disagreement with how the prosecution was being handled prompted the criminal section chief's resignation in the U.S. Attorney's office that brought the case. The indictment charged Abrego-Garcia with one count of conspiracy to transport undocumented individuals and one count of unlawful transportation of undocumented individuals. Abrego-Garcia made his initial court appearance that same day in the Middle District of Tennessee before U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, the government requested a pretrial detention hearing. The court granted the request, but the judge ultimately denied the government\u2019s motion to detain Abrego-Garcia. The government moved to stay that decision on June 22, 2025, but the motion was also denied. In her opinion denying the stay, Judge Crenshaw found that the government had not made a \u201cstrong showing\u201d that the four stay factors weighed in the government's favor.\n\nAbrego-Garcia remained in custody as the government and his attorneys submitted statements regarding potential release conditions. On July 2, the government moved for the court to revoke the magistrate judge's release order. The government made separate statements that once Abrego-Garcia is released from criminal custody, it will take him into immigration custody and again remove him to El Salvador.\n\nIn response, Abrego-Garciamoved for the court to delay his release until the July 16 hearing on the government's motion for revocation. Abrego-Garciaalleged that this would be the only way to ensure that the government does not remove him to a '\"third country\" as soon as the Court released Abrego-Garciafrom pretrial detention. The court granted this motion on June 30, 2025. On July 20, Abrego-Garciamoved, with the government's consent, for a 30-day stay of the issuance of any release order. Abrego-Garciaclaimed he had been \"advised by the government that if the Court denies the government's motion for revocation, the defendant would be transferred to the custody of [DHS], and DHS would begin removal proceedings.\"\n\nIn response, Abrego-Garcia moved for emergency relief in the District Court of Maryland on June 26, 2025. Abrego-Garcia requested the court order the government to:\n\n\u2022 Return him to Maryland immediately upon his release from confinement in Tennessee.   \u2022 Refrain from removing him from the United States or from transferring him outside the District of Maryland.\n\nOn July 24, Judge Xinis prohibited the administration from re-arresting Abrego-Garcia upon his release in Tennessee. Judge Crenshaw denied the administration\u2019s motion to revoke the release order for Kilmar Abrego-Garcia from criminal detention, noting the administration failed to justify continued pretrial detention. Later that day, Magistrate Judge Holmes granted a 30-day stay of the order, keeping Garcia in U.S. Marshal custody.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, Abrego-Garcia waived his right to a speedy trial and consent to a continuance of up to 127 days. Following this waiver, on August 19, Abrego-Garcia moved the court to dismiss for vindictive and selective prosecution. In the alternative, the defendant requested discovery and an evidentiary hearing to investigate his claims.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

Despite this order withholding his removal, Abrego-Garcia was deported due to what the U.S. government termed an \"administrative error.\"\u00a0 On March 24, 2025, Abrego-Garcia filed a habeas petition in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (8:25-cv-00951).

Upon arrival, they were sent to the country\u2019s mega-prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center or CECOT.\n\nThe defendant in this case, Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, is a Salvadoran national residing in the United States who had previously received protection from removal from an immigration judge. Despite this order withholding his removal, Abrego-Garcia was deported due to what the U.S. government termed an \"administrative error.\"\u00a0 On March 24, 2025, Abrego-Garcia filed a habeas petition in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (8:25-cv-00951). It may be useful to read about that habeas case [../../../../case/46283/] before reading the summary of this one; throughout this case summary, we refer to that lawsuit as the habeas case or habeas court. On April 4, 2025, the habeas court ordered the government to facilitate Abrego-Garcia's return to the United States.\n\nOn June 6, 2025 the government informed the habeas court that it had \"successfully facilitated Abrego-Garcia\u2019s return,\" and that he would stand trial on criminal charges in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The government filed a human smuggling indictment against Abrego-Garcia; press reports [https://abcnews.go.com/US/mistakenly-deported-kilmar-abrego-garcia-back-us-face/story?id=121333122] said that disagreement with how the prosecution was being handled prompted the criminal section chief's resignation in the U.S. Attorney's office that brought the case. The indictment charged Abrego-Garcia with one count of conspiracy to transport undocumented individuals and one count of unlawful transportation of undocumented individuals. Abrego-Garcia made his initial court appearance that same day in the Middle District of Tennessee before U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, the government requested a pretrial detention hearing. The court granted the request, but the judge ultimately denied the government\u2019s motion to detain Abrego-Garcia. The government moved to stay that decision on June 22, 2025, but the motion was also denied. In her opinion denying the stay, Judge Crenshaw found that the government had not made a \u201cstrong showing\u201d that the four stay factors weighed in the government's favor.\n\nAbrego-Garcia remained in custody as the government and his attorneys submitted statements regarding potential release conditions. On July 2, the government moved for the court to revoke the magistrate judge's release order. The government made separate statements that once Abrego-Garcia is released from criminal custody, it will take him into immigration custody and again remove him to El Salvador.\n\nIn response, Abrego-Garciamoved for the court to delay his release until the July 16 hearing on the government's motion for revocation. Abrego-Garciaalleged that this would be the only way to ensure that the government does not remove him to a '\"third country\" as soon as the Court released Abrego-Garciafrom pretrial detention. The court granted this motion on June 30, 2025. On July 20, Abrego-Garciamoved, with the government's consent, for a 30-day stay of the issuance of any release order. Abrego-Garciaclaimed he had been \"advised by the government that if the Court denies the government's motion for revocation, the defendant would be transferred to the custody of [DHS], and DHS would begin removal proceedings.\"\n\nIn response, Abrego-Garcia moved for emergency relief in the District Court of Maryland on June 26, 2025. Abrego-Garcia requested the court order the government to:\n\n\u2022 Return him to Maryland immediately upon his release from confinement in Tennessee.   \u2022 Refrain from removing him from the United States or from transferring him outside the District of Maryland.\n\nOn July 24, Judge Xinis prohibited the administration from re-arresting Abrego-Garcia upon his release in Tennessee. Judge Crenshaw denied the administration\u2019s motion to revoke the release order for Kilmar Abrego-Garcia from criminal detention, noting the administration failed to justify continued pretrial detention. Later that day, Magistrate Judge Holmes granted a 30-day stay of the order, keeping Garcia in U.S. Marshal custody.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, Abrego-Garcia waived his right to a speedy trial and consent to a continuance of up to 127 days. Following this waiver, on August 19, Abrego-Garcia moved the court to dismiss for vindictive and selective prosecution. In the alternative, the defendant requested discovery and an evidentiary hearing to investigate his claims.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

Upon arrival, they were sent to the country\u2019s mega-prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center or CECOT.\n\nThe defendant in this case, Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, is a Salvadoran national residing in the United States who had previously received protection from removal from an immigration judge. Despite this order withholding his removal, Abrego-Garcia was deported due to what the U.S. government termed an \"administrative error.\"\u00a0 On March 24, 2025, Abrego-Garcia filed a habeas petition in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (8:25-cv-00951). It may be useful to read about that habeas case [../../../../case/46283/] before reading the summary of this one; throughout this case summary, we refer to that lawsuit as the habeas case or habeas court. On April 4, 2025, the habeas court ordered the government to facilitate Abrego-Garcia's return to the United States.\n\nOn June 6, 2025 the government informed the habeas court that it had \"successfully facilitated Abrego-Garcia\u2019s return,\" and that he would stand trial on criminal charges in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The government filed a human smuggling indictment against Abrego-Garcia; press reports [https://abcnews.go.com/US/mistakenly-deported-kilmar-abrego-garcia-back-us-face/story?id=121333122] said that disagreement with how the prosecution was being handled prompted the criminal section chief's resignation in the U.S. Attorney's office that brought the case. The indictment charged Abrego-Garcia with one count of conspiracy to transport undocumented individuals and one count of unlawful transportation of undocumented individuals. Abrego-Garcia made his initial court appearance that same day in the Middle District of Tennessee before U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, the government requested a pretrial detention hearing. The court granted the request, but the judge ultimately denied the government\u2019s motion to detain Abrego-Garcia. The government moved to stay that decision on June 22, 2025, but the motion was also denied. In her opinion denying the stay, Judge Crenshaw found that the government had not made a \u201cstrong showing\u201d that the four stay factors weighed in the government's favor.\n\nAbrego-Garcia remained in custody as the government and his attorneys submitted statements regarding potential release conditions. On July 2, the government moved for the court to revoke the magistrate judge's release order. The government made separate statements that once Abrego-Garcia is released from criminal custody, it will take him into immigration custody and again remove him to El Salvador.\n\nIn response, Abrego-Garciamoved for the court to delay his release until the July 16 hearing on the government's motion for revocation. Abrego-Garciaalleged that this would be the only way to ensure that the government does not remove him to a '\"third country\" as soon as the Court released Abrego-Garciafrom pretrial detention. The court granted this motion on June 30, 2025. On July 20, Abrego-Garciamoved, with the government's consent, for a 30-day stay of the issuance of any release order. Abrego-Garciaclaimed he had been \"advised by the government that if the Court denies the government's motion for revocation, the defendant would be transferred to the custody of [DHS], and DHS would begin removal proceedings.\"\n\nIn response, Abrego-Garcia moved for emergency relief in the District Court of Maryland on June 26, 2025. Abrego-Garcia requested the court order the government to:\n\n\u2022 Return him to Maryland immediately upon his release from confinement in Tennessee.   \u2022 Refrain from removing him from the United States or from transferring him outside the District of Maryland.\n\nOn July 24, Judge Xinis prohibited the administration from re-arresting Abrego-Garcia upon his release in Tennessee. Judge Crenshaw denied the administration\u2019s motion to revoke the release order for Kilmar Abrego-Garcia from criminal detention, noting the administration failed to justify continued pretrial detention. Later that day, Magistrate Judge Holmes granted a 30-day stay of the order, keeping Garcia in U.S. Marshal custody.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, Abrego-Garcia waived his right to a speedy trial and consent to a continuance of up to 127 days. Following this waiver, on August 19, Abrego-Garcia moved the court to dismiss for vindictive and selective prosecution. In the alternative, the defendant requested discovery and an evidentiary hearing to investigate his claims.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

Upon arrival, they were sent to the country\u2019s mega-prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center or CECOT.\n\nThe defendant in this case, Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, is a Salvadoran national residing in the United States who had previously received protection from removal from an immigration judge. Despite this order withholding his removal, Abrego-Garcia was deported due to what the U.S. government termed an \"administrative error.\"\u00a0 On March 24, 2025, Abrego-Garcia filed a habeas petition in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (8:25-cv-00951). It may be useful to read about that habeas case [../../../../case/46283/] before reading the summary of this one; throughout this case summary, we refer to that lawsuit as the habeas case or habeas court. On April 4, 2025, the habeas court ordered the government to facilitate Abrego-Garcia's return to the United States.\n\nOn June 6, 2025 the government informed the habeas court that it had \"successfully facilitated Abrego-Garcia\u2019s return,\" and that he would stand trial on criminal charges in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The government filed a human smuggling indictment against Abrego-Garcia; press reports [https://abcnews.go.com/US/mistakenly-deported-kilmar-abrego-garcia-back-us-face/story?id=121333122] said that disagreement with how the prosecution was being handled prompted the criminal section chief's resignation in the U.S. Attorney's office that brought the case. The indictment charged Abrego-Garcia with one count of conspiracy to transport undocumented individuals and one count of unlawful transportation of undocumented individuals. Abrego-Garcia made his initial court appearance that same day in the Middle District of Tennessee before U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, the government requested a pretrial detention hearing. The court granted the request, but the judge ultimately denied the government\u2019s motion to detain Abrego-Garcia. The government moved to stay that decision on June 22, 2025, but the motion was also denied. In her opinion denying the stay, Judge Crenshaw found that the government had not made a \u201cstrong showing\u201d that the four stay factors weighed in the government's favor.\n\nAbrego-Garcia remained in custody as the government and his attorneys submitted statements regarding potential release conditions. On July 2, the government moved for the court to revoke the magistrate judge's release order. The government made separate statements that once Abrego-Garcia is released from criminal custody, it will take him into immigration custody and again remove him to El Salvador.\n\nIn response, Abrego-Garciamoved for the court to delay his release until the July 16 hearing on the government's motion for revocation. Abrego-Garciaalleged that this would be the only way to ensure that the government does not remove him to a '\"third country\" as soon as the Court released Abrego-Garciafrom pretrial detention. The court granted this motion on June 30, 2025. On July 20, Abrego-Garciamoved, with the government's consent, for a 30-day stay of the issuance of any release order. Abrego-Garciaclaimed he had been \"advised by the government that if the Court denies the government's motion for revocation, the defendant would be transferred to the custody of [DHS], and DHS would begin removal proceedings.\"\n\nIn response, Abrego-Garcia moved for emergency relief in the District Court of Maryland on June 26, 2025. Abrego-Garcia requested the court order the government to:\n\n\u2022 Return him to Maryland immediately upon his release from confinement in Tennessee.   \u2022 Refrain from removing him from the United States or from transferring him outside the District of Maryland.\n\nOn July 24, Judge Xinis prohibited the administration from re-arresting Abrego-Garcia upon his release in Tennessee. Judge Crenshaw denied the administration\u2019s motion to revoke the release order for Kilmar Abrego-Garcia from criminal detention, noting the administration failed to justify continued pretrial detention. Later that day, Magistrate Judge Holmes granted a 30-day stay of the order, keeping Garcia in U.S. Marshal custody.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, Abrego-Garcia waived his right to a speedy trial and consent to a continuance of up to 127 days.
