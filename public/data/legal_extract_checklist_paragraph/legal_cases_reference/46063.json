    "target": "This case challenged the Department of Education\u2019s decision to allow the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to access sensitive student financial aid records.\n\nWhen President Trump was inaugurated on January 20, 2025, one of his first acts was the issuance of an executive order establishing a \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency.\u201d In the executive order, President Trump renamed the United States Digital Service as the United States DOGE Service (USDS) and ordered the USDS administrator to work with Agency Heads to promote data collection synchronization and ensure data integrity. \u00a0Since the executive order, DOGE staffers have gained access to a \"financial aid dataset containing personal information for millions of students enrolled in the federal student aid program.\"\n\nOn February 7, 2025, the University of California Student Association, a nonprofit association of undergraduate students at the University of California campuses, filed this lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by against the Department of Education and its Secretary, seeking to halt Defendants' disclosure of sensitive personal and financial information to DOGE. Plaintiff alleged that Defendants' release of sensitive student information--including their Social Security numbers, date of birth, and financial information--was unlawful. On Count I, Plaintiff alleged that Defendants' actions were \"contrary to law\" in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103; and the Privacy Act. On Count II, Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants' action was \"arbitrary and capricious\" under the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). On Count III, Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants' action constituted an \"excess of statutory authority\" under the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(C). Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief enjoining Defendants from continuing to permit such access or obtain such personal information and ensuring that any future disclosure of information occurs only in accordance with the law.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Randolph D. Moss.\n\nOn Feb. 10, 2025, plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order (TRO); after briefing and a hearing on Feb. 14, Judge Moss took the motion under advisement.\n\nOn February 17, the court denied the TRO. The court found that \u201cmere access\u201d to personal data by government employees lacking authorization to view such data did not create an \u201cirreparable injury\u201d necessary for the grant of a TRO. The court reasoned that the dissemination of information is an irreparable injury where highly sensitive information is made public. Here, the Defendants\u2019 staffers were required to keep the private information confidential in accordance with the Privacy Act; since there was no public disclosure of information, the court found that there was no irreparable injury.\n\nPlaintiffs sought an order for expedited discovery. Citing the court's order in New Mexico v. Musk [../../../../case/46121/], No. 25-cv-429 in a notice for supplemental authority, Plaintiffs argued that expedited discovery in support of\u00a0 a preliminary injunction motion would be reasonable in this case. This motion was denied on March 18.\n\nOn April 8, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. The following day, Plaintiffs moved to voluntarily dismiss the case. On April 16, the court ordered that the case is dismissed without prejudice.\n\nThis case is closed.",

Plaintiff alleged that Defendants' release of sensitive student information--including their Social Security numbers, date of birth, and financial information--was unlawful. On Count I, Plaintiff alleged that Defendants' actions were \"contrary to law\" in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103; and the Privacy Act. On Count II, Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants' action was \"arbitrary and capricious\" under the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). On Count III, Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants' action constituted an \"excess of statutory authority\" under the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(C). Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief enjoining Defendants from continuing to permit such access or obtain such personal information and ensuring that any future disclosure of information occurs only in accordance with the law.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Randolph D. Moss.\n\nOn Feb. 10, 2025, plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order (TRO); after briefing and a hearing on Feb. 14, Judge Moss took the motion under advisement.\n\nOn February 17, the court denied the TRO. The court found that \u201cmere access\u201d to personal data by government employees lacking authorization to view such data did not create an \u201cirreparable injury\u201d necessary for the grant of a TRO. The court reasoned that the dissemination of information is an irreparable injury where highly sensitive information is made public. Here, the Defendants\u2019 staffers were required to keep the private information confidential in accordance with the Privacy Act; since there was no public disclosure of information, the court found that there was no irreparable injury.\n\nPlaintiffs sought an order for expedited discovery. Citing the court's order in New Mexico v. Musk [../../../../case/46121/], No. 25-cv-429 in a notice for supplemental authority, Plaintiffs argued that expedited discovery in support of\u00a0 a preliminary injunction motion would be reasonable in this case.

Plaintiff alleged that Defendants' release of sensitive student information--including their Social Security numbers, date of birth, and financial information--was unlawful. On Count I, Plaintiff alleged that Defendants' actions were \"contrary to law\" in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103; and the Privacy Act. On Count II, Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants' action was \"arbitrary and capricious\" under the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). On Count III, Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants' action constituted an \"excess of statutory authority\" under the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(C). Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief enjoining Defendants from continuing to permit such access or obtain such personal information and ensuring that any future disclosure of information occurs only in accordance with the law.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Randolph D.

The court found that \u201cmere access\u201d to personal data by government employees lacking authorization to view such data did not create an \u201cirreparable injury\u201d necessary for the grant of a TRO. The court reasoned that the dissemination of information is an irreparable injury where highly sensitive information is made public. Here, the Defendants\u2019 staffers were required to keep the private information confidential in accordance with the Privacy Act; since there was no public disclosure of information, the court found that there was no irreparable injury.\n\nPlaintiffs sought an order for expedited discovery. Citing the court's order in New Mexico v. Musk [../../../../case/46121/], No. 25-cv-429 in a notice for supplemental authority, Plaintiffs argued that expedited discovery in support of\u00a0 a preliminary injunction motion would be reasonable in this case.
