    "target": "This is a case about access to the Federal Register in prison. The plaintiff, who was incarcerated in federal prison, filed this lawsuit on February 22, 2019, against the Federal Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. Though the plaintiff's initial complaint was about an unrelated issue, in a subsequent amended complaint (filed January 10, 2020) the plaintiff brought a claim under the Administrative Procedure Act against the US Attorney General and BOP officials. The plaintiff alleged that the BOP had violated his First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights by denying him access to the Federal Register, and therefore preventing him from engaging in public comment on proposed rulemakings, including those of the BOP. The plaintiff, representing himself, sought a declaratory judgment, an injunction requiring BOP to make the Federal Register available in its prisons, and money damages. Judge Phil Gilbert presided.\n\nOn April 23, 2020, the court dismissed the amended complaint upon preliminary review as frivolous and meritless. 2020 WL 1955283. Plaintiff appealed to the Seventh Circuit on May 28, 2020. The Seventh Circuit appointed counsel to assist Plaintiff with his appeal. On March 29, 2021, the Seventh Circuit vacated the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the case and remanded it for further proceedings. 841 Fed.Appx. 1011. The Seventh Circuit held that the District Court erred by resolving a factual dispute\u2014whether the BOP had provided Plaintiff access to its proposed rulemakings\u2014in favor of Defendants. The District Court had also not properly addressed the broader issue of access to the Federal Register\u00a0for other agencies' rulemakings. The case was remanded, though the District Court subsequently dismissed any individual claims for monetary damages. 2021 WL 2333764.\n\nBack in the District Court, Plaintiff filed a series of motions requesting that the court appoint him counsel, but the district court denied these motions because he had not properly justified the need for appointed counsel. On November 10, 2022, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Plaintiff had access to BOP's proposed rules and regulations via the inmate electronic bulletin board, and that not providing access to the broader Federal Register did not violate Plaintiff's rights.\n\nOn March 31, 2023, the District Court granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. 2023 WL 2743584. First, the court found that Plaintiff did have access to the BOP\u2019s proposed regulatory rule changes. The court also found that Defendants were not acting arbitrarily and capriciously in failing to provide inmates with a complete copy of the entire Federal Register, and that Defendants\u2019 decision not to provide complete copies of the Federal Register to inmates was rationally related to a legitimate penological interest of the institution. Finally, the court held that the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments were not implicated in these claims. The court subsequently dismissed Plaintiff's complaint with prejudice and directed the Clerk to enter judgment in favor of Defendants.\n\nOn April 17, 2023, Plaintiff appealed the grant of summary judgment and the District Court\u2019s denial of his motions for recruitment of counsel. On June 30, 2024, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the final judgment, finding that the BOP\u2019s policy was reasonably related to its legitimate penological interest and that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the request for recruitment of counsel. 109 F.4th 975.\n\nThis case is now closed.",

Though the plaintiff's initial complaint was about an unrelated issue, in a subsequent amended complaint (filed January 10, 2020) the plaintiff brought a claim under the Administrative Procedure Act against the US Attorney General and BOP officials.

    "target": "This is a case about access to the Federal Register in prison. The plaintiff, who was incarcerated in federal prison, filed this lawsuit on February 22, 2019, against the Federal Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. Though the plaintiff's initial complaint was about an unrelated issue, in a subsequent amended complaint (filed January 10, 2020) the plaintiff brought a claim under the Administrative Procedure Act against the US Attorney General and BOP officials. The plaintiff alleged that the BOP had violated his First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights by denying him access to the Federal Register, and therefore preventing him from engaging in public comment on proposed rulemakings, including those of the BOP. The plaintiff, representing himself, sought a declaratory judgment, an injunction requiring BOP to make the Federal Register available in its prisons, and money damages. Judge Phil Gilbert presided.\n\nOn April 23, 2020, the court dismissed the amended complaint upon preliminary review as frivolous and meritless. 2020 WL 1955283. Plaintiff appealed to the Seventh Circuit on May 28, 2020. The Seventh Circuit appointed counsel to assist Plaintiff with his appeal. On March 29, 2021, the Seventh Circuit vacated the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the case and remanded it for further proceedings. 841 Fed.Appx. 1011. The Seventh Circuit held that the District Court erred by resolving a factual dispute\u2014whether the BOP had provided Plaintiff access to its proposed rulemakings\u2014in favor of Defendants. The District Court had also not properly addressed the broader issue of access to the Federal Register\u00a0for other agencies' rulemakings. The case was remanded, though the District Court subsequently dismissed any individual claims for monetary damages. 2021 WL 2333764.\n\nBack in the District Court, Plaintiff filed a series of motions requesting that the court appoint him counsel, but the district court denied these motions because he had not properly justified the need for appointed counsel. On November 10, 2022, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Plaintiff had access to BOP's proposed rules and regulations via the inmate electronic bulletin board, and that not providing access to the broader Federal Register did not violate Plaintiff's rights.\n\nOn March 31, 2023, the District Court granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. 2023 WL 2743584. First, the court found that Plaintiff did have access to the BOP\u2019s proposed regulatory rule changes. The court also found that Defendants were not acting arbitrarily and capriciously in failing to provide inmates with a complete copy of the entire Federal Register, and that Defendants\u2019 decision not to provide complete copies of the Federal Register to inmates was rationally related to a legitimate penological interest of the institution. Finally, the court held that the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments were not implicated in these claims. The court subsequently dismissed Plaintiff's complaint with prejudice and directed the Clerk to enter judgment in favor of Defendants.\n\nOn April 17, 2023, Plaintiff appealed the grant of summary judgment and the District Court\u2019s denial of his motions for recruitment of counsel. On June 30, 2024, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the final judgment, finding that the BOP\u2019s policy was reasonably related to its legitimate penological interest and that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the request for recruitment of counsel. 109 F.4th 975.\n\nThis case is now closed.",

    "target": "This is a case about access to the Federal Register in prison. The plaintiff, who was incarcerated in federal prison, filed this lawsuit on February 22, 2019, against the Federal Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. Though the plaintiff's initial complaint was about an unrelated issue, in a subsequent amended complaint (filed January 10, 2020) the plaintiff brought a claim under the Administrative Procedure Act against the US Attorney General and BOP officials. The plaintiff alleged that the BOP had violated his First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights by denying him access to the Federal Register, and therefore preventing him from engaging in public comment on proposed rulemakings, including those of the BOP. The plaintiff, representing himself, sought a declaratory judgment, an injunction requiring BOP to make the Federal Register available in its prisons, and money damages. Judge Phil Gilbert presided.\n\nOn April 23, 2020, the court dismissed the amended complaint upon preliminary review as frivolous and meritless. 2020 WL 1955283. Plaintiff appealed to the Seventh Circuit on May 28, 2020. The Seventh Circuit appointed counsel to assist Plaintiff with his appeal. On March 29, 2021, the Seventh Circuit vacated the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the case and remanded it for further proceedings. 841 Fed.Appx. 1011. The Seventh Circuit held that the District Court erred by resolving a factual dispute\u2014whether the BOP had provided Plaintiff access to its proposed rulemakings\u2014in favor of Defendants. The District Court had also not properly addressed the broader issue of access to the Federal Register\u00a0for other agencies' rulemakings. The case was remanded, though the District Court subsequently dismissed any individual claims for monetary damages. 2021 WL 2333764.\n\nBack in the District Court, Plaintiff filed a series of motions requesting that the court appoint him counsel, but the district court denied these motions because he had not properly justified the need for appointed counsel. On November 10, 2022, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Plaintiff had access to BOP's proposed rules and regulations via the inmate electronic bulletin board, and that not providing access to the broader Federal Register did not violate Plaintiff's rights.\n\nOn March 31, 2023, the District Court granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. 2023 WL 2743584. First, the court found that Plaintiff did have access to the BOP\u2019s proposed regulatory rule changes. The court also found that Defendants were not acting arbitrarily and capriciously in failing to provide inmates with a complete copy of the entire Federal Register, and that Defendants\u2019 decision not to provide complete copies of the Federal Register to inmates was rationally related to a legitimate penological interest of the institution. Finally, the court held that the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments were not implicated in these claims. The court subsequently dismissed Plaintiff's complaint with prejudice and directed the Clerk to enter judgment in favor of Defendants.\n\nOn April 17, 2023, Plaintiff appealed the grant of summary judgment and the District Court\u2019s denial of his motions for recruitment of counsel. On June 30, 2024, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the final judgment, finding that the BOP\u2019s policy was reasonably related to its legitimate penological interest and that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the request for recruitment of counsel. 109 F.4th 975.\n\nThis case is now closed.",
