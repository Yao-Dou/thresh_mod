You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38954&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 22, 2025, twelve international students and graduates on F-1 visas and post-graduate Optional Practical Training (OPT) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Trump, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the ICE Field Office Director of San Francisco. The plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The case was initially assigned to Judge P. Casey Pitts, but reassigned to Judge Steven White on April 24, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that between April 4 and 8, 2025, the defendants abruptly terminated their F-1 visas and records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), effectively stripping them of their ability to remain students in the United States. The stated reason was \u201cotherwise failing to maintain status,\u201d and that they had been \u201cidentified in a criminal records check and/or had their visa revoked.\u201d The plaintiffs contended that they had fully complied with the terms of their F-1 status and engaged in no conduct warranting termination. They argued that the SEVIS terminations and subsequent visa revocations appeared to be part of a policy intended to coerce international students into abandoning their studies and self-deporting.\n\nRepresented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, restoration of their SEVIS records and F-1 statuses, and protection from enforcement or deportation. They further sought to enjoin the defendants from detaining or transferring them during the proceedings. The plaintiffs did not challenge the visa revocations, arguing that F-1 status could remain valid despite revocation.\n\nOn April 23, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.\n\nThe court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order on April 25, 2025, enjoining the defendants from arresting or transferring the named plaintiffs or enforcing any legal effect from the termination of their SEVIS records or potential F-1 visa revocations until May 15, 2025. The court found that the plaintiffs had shown \"at least serious questions exist\" on their claims under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 distinction between an active SEVIS record and lawful F-1 status, noting that terminating a SEVIS record effectively ended F-1 status. The order described the defendants\u2019 \u201cStudent Criminal Alien Initiative,\u201d in which ICE terminated thousands of SEVIS records based on criminal database checks and a State Department request, and noted a new policy listing visa revocation as a reason for termination. The injunction barred the defendants from arresting, detaining, or transferring the named plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals, from imposing adverse legal effects from SEVIS terminations, and from reversing reinstated SEVIS records of individuals maintaining their status without court approval.\n\nThe defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025. They argued that the injunction exceeded the court\u2019s authority as a nationwide order, citing Trump v. CASA, Inc., and that the plaintiffs failed to show irreparable harm because ICE had already reactivated SEVIS records retroactively. They also contended that the injunction was vague and overbroad, restricting lawful enforcement and exposing DHS officers to contempt, and improperly limited their authority to terminate SEVIS records unrelated to the \u201cStudent Criminal Alien Initiative.\u201d\n\nOn August 8, 2025, the defendants moved to stay the injunction\u2019s nationwide scope, its bar on arresting or transferring the plaintiffs for reasons unrelated to SEVIS termination, and its restriction on terminating SEVIS records outside the Criminal Alien Initiative.\n\nOn August 22, 2025, the Ninth Circuit granted, in part, and denied, in part, the defendants\u2019 motion to stay pending appeal. \u00a0The court upheld the universal scope of the injunction, finding that Trump v. CASA did not bar nationwide relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, and concluded that the defendants had not shown irreparable harm. The court modified the arrest and transfer provisions, allowing arrests only if based on new material information unrelated to the SEVIS terminations, but denied any modification to the reversal provision, maintaining that defendants cannot reverse reinstated SEVIS records without court approval.\n\nThis case remains ongoing.",

    "target": "This case is one of numerous lawsuits challenging the Trump administration\u2019s abrupt termination of immigration visas\u2014mostly student or work visas\u2014with no notice to the visa-holders and with dubious or no legal basis. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38954&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 22, 2025, twelve international students and graduates on F-1 visas and post-graduate Optional Practical Training (OPT) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Trump, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the ICE Field Office Director of San Francisco. The plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The case was initially assigned to Judge P. Casey Pitts, but reassigned to Judge Steven White on April 24, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that between April 4 and 8, 2025, the defendants abruptly terminated their F-1 visas and records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), effectively stripping them of their ability to remain students in the United States. The stated reason was \u201cotherwise failing to maintain status,\u201d and that they had been \u201cidentified in a criminal records check and/or had their visa revoked.\u201d The plaintiffs contended that they had fully complied with the terms of their F-1 status and engaged in no conduct warranting termination. They argued that the SEVIS terminations and subsequent visa revocations appeared to be part of a policy intended to coerce international students into abandoning their studies and self-deporting.\n\nRepresented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, restoration of their SEVIS records and F-1 statuses, and protection from enforcement or deportation. They further sought to enjoin the defendants from detaining or transferring them during the proceedings. The plaintiffs did not challenge the visa revocations, arguing that F-1 status could remain valid despite revocation.\n\nOn April 23, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.\n\nThe court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order on April 25, 2025, enjoining the defendants from arresting or transferring the named plaintiffs or enforcing any legal effect from the termination of their SEVIS records or potential F-1 visa revocations until May 15, 2025. The court found that the plaintiffs had shown \"at least serious questions exist\" on their claims under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 distinction between an active SEVIS record and lawful F-1 status, noting that terminating a SEVIS record effectively ended F-1 status. The order described the defendants\u2019 \u201cStudent Criminal Alien Initiative,\u201d in which ICE terminated thousands of SEVIS records based on criminal database checks and a State Department request, and noted a new policy listing visa revocation as a reason for termination. The injunction barred the defendants from arresting, detaining, or transferring the named plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals, from imposing adverse legal effects from SEVIS terminations, and from reversing reinstated SEVIS records of individuals maintaining their status without court approval.\n\nThe defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025. They argued that the injunction exceeded the court\u2019s authority as a nationwide order, citing Trump v. CASA, Inc., and that the plaintiffs failed to show irreparable harm because ICE had already reactivated SEVIS records retroactively. They also contended that the injunction was vague and overbroad, restricting lawful enforcement and exposing DHS officers to contempt, and improperly limited their authority to terminate SEVIS records unrelated to the \u201cStudent Criminal Alien Initiative.\u201d\n\nOn August 8, 2025, the defendants moved to stay the injunction\u2019s nationwide scope, its bar on arresting or transferring the plaintiffs for reasons unrelated to SEVIS termination, and its restriction on terminating SEVIS records outside the Criminal Alien Initiative.\n\nOn August 22, 2025, the Ninth Circuit granted, in part, and denied, in part, the defendants\u2019 motion to stay pending appeal. \u00a0The court upheld the universal scope of the injunction, finding that Trump v. CASA did not bar nationwide relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, and concluded that the defendants had not shown irreparable harm. The court modified the arrest and transfer provisions, allowing arrests only if based on new material information unrelated to the SEVIS terminations, but denied any modification to the reversal provision, maintaining that defendants cannot reverse reinstated SEVIS records without court approval.\n\nThis case remains ongoing.",

You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38954&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 22, 2025, twelve international students and graduates on F-1 visas and post-graduate Optional Practical Training (OPT) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Trump, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the ICE Field Office Director of San Francisco. The plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The case was initially assigned to Judge P.

They further sought to enjoin the defendants from detaining or transferring them during the proceedings. The plaintiffs did not challenge the visa revocations, arguing that F-1 status could remain valid despite revocation.\n\nOn April 23, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.\n\nThe court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order on April 25, 2025, enjoining the defendants from arresting or transferring the named plaintiffs or enforcing any legal effect from the termination of their SEVIS records or potential F-1 visa revocations until May 15, 2025.

    "target": "This case is one of numerous lawsuits challenging the Trump administration\u2019s abrupt termination of immigration visas\u2014mostly student or work visas\u2014with no notice to the visa-holders and with dubious or no legal basis. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38954&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 22, 2025, twelve international students and graduates on F-1 visas and post-graduate Optional Practical Training (OPT) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Trump, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the ICE Field Office Director of San Francisco. The plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The case was initially assigned to Judge P. Casey Pitts, but reassigned to Judge Steven White on April 24, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that between April 4 and 8, 2025, the defendants abruptly terminated their F-1 visas and records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), effectively stripping them of their ability to remain students in the United States. The stated reason was \u201cotherwise failing to maintain status,\u201d and that they had been \u201cidentified in a criminal records check and/or had their visa revoked.\u201d The plaintiffs contended that they had fully complied with the terms of their F-1 status and engaged in no conduct warranting termination. They argued that the SEVIS terminations and subsequent visa revocations appeared to be part of a policy intended to coerce international students into abandoning their studies and self-deporting.\n\nRepresented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, restoration of their SEVIS records and F-1 statuses, and protection from enforcement or deportation. They further sought to enjoin the defendants from detaining or transferring them during the proceedings. The plaintiffs did not challenge the visa revocations, arguing that F-1 status could remain valid despite revocation.\n\nOn April 23, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.\n\nThe court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order on April 25, 2025, enjoining the defendants from arresting or transferring the named plaintiffs or enforcing any legal effect from the termination of their SEVIS records or potential F-1 visa revocations until May 15, 2025. The court found that the plaintiffs had shown \"at least serious questions exist\" on their claims under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 distinction between an active SEVIS record and lawful F-1 status, noting that terminating a SEVIS record effectively ended F-1 status. The order described the defendants\u2019 \u201cStudent Criminal Alien Initiative,\u201d in which ICE terminated thousands of SEVIS records based on criminal database checks and a State Department request, and noted a new policy listing visa revocation as a reason for termination. The injunction barred the defendants from arresting, detaining, or transferring the named plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals, from imposing adverse legal effects from SEVIS terminations, and from reversing reinstated SEVIS records of individuals maintaining their status without court approval.\n\nThe defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025. They argued that the injunction exceeded the court\u2019s authority as a nationwide order, citing Trump v. CASA, Inc., and that the plaintiffs failed to show irreparable harm because ICE had already reactivated SEVIS records retroactively. They also contended that the injunction was vague and overbroad, restricting lawful enforcement and exposing DHS officers to contempt, and improperly limited their authority to terminate SEVIS records unrelated to the \u201cStudent Criminal Alien Initiative.\u201d\n\nOn August 8, 2025, the defendants moved to stay the injunction\u2019s nationwide scope, its bar on arresting or transferring the plaintiffs for reasons unrelated to SEVIS termination, and its restriction on terminating SEVIS records outside the Criminal Alien Initiative.\n\nOn August 22, 2025, the Ninth Circuit granted, in part, and denied, in part, the defendants\u2019 motion to stay pending appeal. \u00a0The court upheld the universal scope of the injunction, finding that Trump v. CASA did not bar nationwide relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, and concluded that the defendants had not shown irreparable harm. The court modified the arrest and transfer provisions, allowing arrests only if based on new material information unrelated to the SEVIS terminations, but denied any modification to the reversal provision, maintaining that defendants cannot reverse reinstated SEVIS records without court approval.\n\nThis case remains ongoing.",

You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38954&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 22, 2025, twelve international students and graduates on F-1 visas and post-graduate Optional Practical Training (OPT) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Trump, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the ICE Field Office Director of San Francisco. The plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The case was initially assigned to Judge P. Casey Pitts, but reassigned to Judge Steven White on April 24, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that between April 4 and 8, 2025, the defendants abruptly terminated their F-1 visas and records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), effectively stripping them of their ability to remain students in the United States. The stated reason was \u201cotherwise failing to maintain status,\u201d and that they had been \u201cidentified in a criminal records check and/or had their visa revoked.\u201d The plaintiffs contended that they had fully complied with the terms of their F-1 status and engaged in no conduct warranting termination. They argued that the SEVIS terminations and subsequent visa revocations appeared to be part of a policy intended to coerce international students into abandoning their studies and self-deporting.\n\nRepresented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, restoration of their SEVIS records and F-1 statuses, and protection from enforcement or deportation. They further sought to enjoin the defendants from detaining or transferring them during the proceedings. The plaintiffs did not challenge the visa revocations, arguing that F-1 status could remain valid despite revocation.\n\nOn April 23, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.\n\nThe court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order on April 25, 2025, enjoining the defendants from arresting or transferring the named plaintiffs or enforcing any legal effect from the termination of their SEVIS records or potential F-1 visa revocations until May 15, 2025. The court found that the plaintiffs had shown \"at least serious questions exist\" on their claims under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 distinction between an active SEVIS record and lawful F-1 status, noting that terminating a SEVIS record effectively ended F-1 status. The order described the defendants\u2019 \u201cStudent Criminal Alien Initiative,\u201d in which ICE terminated thousands of SEVIS records based on criminal database checks and a State Department request, and noted a new policy listing visa revocation as a reason for termination. The injunction barred the defendants from arresting, detaining, or transferring the named plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals, from imposing adverse legal effects from SEVIS terminations, and from reversing reinstated SEVIS records of individuals maintaining their status without court approval.\n\nThe defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025. They argued that the injunction exceeded the court\u2019s authority as a nationwide order, citing Trump v.

You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38954&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 22, 2025, twelve international students and graduates on F-1 visas and post-graduate Optional Practical Training (OPT) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Trump, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the ICE Field Office Director of San Francisco. The plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The case was initially assigned to Judge P. Casey Pitts, but reassigned to Judge Steven White on April 24, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that between April 4 and 8, 2025, the defendants abruptly terminated their F-1 visas and records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), effectively stripping them of their ability to remain students in the United States. The stated reason was \u201cotherwise failing to maintain status,\u201d and that they had been \u201cidentified in a criminal records check and/or had their visa revoked.\u201d The plaintiffs contended that they had fully complied with the terms of their F-1 status and engaged in no conduct warranting termination. They argued that the SEVIS terminations and subsequent visa revocations appeared to be part of a policy intended to coerce international students into abandoning their studies and self-deporting.\n\nRepresented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, restoration of their SEVIS records and F-1 statuses, and protection from enforcement or deportation. They further sought to enjoin the defendants from detaining or transferring them during the proceedings. The plaintiffs did not challenge the visa revocations, arguing that F-1 status could remain valid despite revocation.\n\nOn April 23, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.\n\nThe court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order on April 25, 2025, enjoining the defendants from arresting or transferring the named plaintiffs or enforcing any legal effect from the termination of their SEVIS records or potential F-1 visa revocations until May 15, 2025. The court found that the plaintiffs had shown \"at least serious questions exist\" on their claims under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 distinction between an active SEVIS record and lawful F-1 status, noting that terminating a SEVIS record effectively ended F-1 status. The order described the defendants\u2019 \u201cStudent Criminal Alien Initiative,\u201d in which ICE terminated thousands of SEVIS records based on criminal database checks and a State Department request, and noted a new policy listing visa revocation as a reason for termination. The injunction barred the defendants from arresting, detaining, or transferring the named plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals, from imposing adverse legal effects from SEVIS terminations, and from reversing reinstated SEVIS records of individuals maintaining their status without court approval.\n\nThe defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025. They argued that the injunction exceeded the court\u2019s authority as a nationwide order, citing Trump v. CASA, Inc., and that the plaintiffs failed to show irreparable harm because ICE had already reactivated SEVIS records retroactively. They also contended that the injunction was vague and overbroad, restricting lawful enforcement and exposing DHS officers to contempt, and improperly limited their authority to terminate SEVIS records unrelated to the \u201cStudent Criminal Alien Initiative.\u201d\n\nOn August 8, 2025, the defendants moved to stay the injunction\u2019s nationwide scope, its bar on arresting or transferring the plaintiffs for reasons unrelated to SEVIS termination, and its restriction on terminating SEVIS records outside the Criminal Alien Initiative.\n\nOn August 22, 2025, the Ninth Circuit granted, in part, and denied, in part, the defendants\u2019 motion to stay pending appeal. \u00a0The court upheld the universal scope of the injunction, finding that Trump v. CASA did not bar nationwide relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, and concluded that the defendants had not shown irreparable harm. The court modified the arrest and transfer provisions, allowing arrests only if based on new material information unrelated to the SEVIS terminations, but denied any modification to the reversal provision, maintaining that defendants cannot reverse reinstated SEVIS records without court approval.\n\nThis case remains ongoing.",
