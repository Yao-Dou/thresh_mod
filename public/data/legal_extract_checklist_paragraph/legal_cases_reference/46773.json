    "target": "This case is about the federal government\u2019s termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. On July 7, 2025, the National TPS Alliance and private plaintiffs who are individual TPS holders filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), its Secretary, and the United States under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Fifth Amendment. The case was assigned to Judge Trina L. Thompson.\n\nThe complaint provided extensive background on the TPS program\u2019s purpose and statutory framework. Congress created TPS in 1990 to replace politically driven discretionary programs like \u201cextended voluntary departure\u201d with decisions based on clear humanitarian standards. TPS designations confer work authorization and protection from deportation. By statute, the Secretary must review country conditions before terminating any designation, with extensions effectively the default absent timely notice. Honduras and Nicaragua were designated in 1999 following Hurricane Mitch; Nepal in 2015 after a major earthquake. These designations were repeatedly extended due to ongoing humanitarian crises.\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, DHS announced TPS terminations between 2017 and 2018, affecting over 400,000 people. Federal courts blocked those terminations, finding they stemmed from a predetermined agenda to end TPS and were tainted by discriminatory animus against non-white immigrants. DHS rescinded those terminations in 2023.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that the second Trump administration renewed this agenda under Executive Order 14159, titled \u201cProtecting the American People Against Invasion,\u201d which directed DHS to rescind prior TPS-related policies and prioritize the removal of non-citizens. Plaintiffs asserted that Secretary Noem\u2019s TPS terminations were preordained, based on a superficial review, and motivated by racial and national-origin animus, citing public statements by Noem, President Trump, and Vice President Vance. Plaintiffs challenged the truncated 60-day transition period\u2014the minimum statutory notice before TPS termination became effective, a significant departure from historical practice\u2014as violating the equal protection guarantee implicit in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and alleged that DHS breached statutory requirements and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nRepresented by nonprofit immigrant rights attorneys, plaintiffs sought an injunction barring DHS from enforcing the terminations and an order maintaining TPS protections. They also sought to have the court set aside, postpone, or stay the terminations, enjoin enforcement, and award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, Judge Thompson granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to expedite briefing and hearing on their request to postpone the effective date of the TPS terminations.\n\nOn July 31, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to postpone the effective date of the TPS terminations for Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal until a hearing on the merits scheduled for November 18, 2025. In its order, the court wrote, \u201cThe freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood. The Court disagrees.\u201d\n\nThe court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the TPS terminations were preordained and not based on an objective assessment of country conditions. The court cited comments made by Secretary Noem before she reviewed any country conditions reports, which suggested a predetermined intent to end the TPS program. The court also found that the terminations failed to address data previously considered relevant, including political violence and crime in Honduras and recurring weather events in Nicaragua. The court determined that terminating TPS would cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs and that the balance of harms and the public interest weighed in favor of postponement. Judge Thompson concluded that the court had jurisdiction to review the case and that the requested relief to postpone the terminations fell within the scope of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThat same day, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the court\u2019s July 31 order. The defendants argued that they were likely to prevail on appeal, citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Noem v. National TPS Alliance, No. 25 cv 1766 EMC (N.D. Cal.), where the district court had erroneously concluded that the Secretary\u2019s action vacating a prior extension of TPS for certain Venezuelans exceeded her statutory authority. The defendants also contended that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief because the TPS statute explicitly barred judicial review of any decision to terminate a TPS designation. The defendants further argued that the balance of harms favored a stay, asserting that the government suffered irreparable harm when its policies were enjoined. Finally, the defendants maintained that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were without merit.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the defendants appealed the July 31 order to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case is about the federal government\u2019s termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. On July 7, 2025, the National TPS Alliance and private plaintiffs who are individual TPS holders filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), its Secretary, and the United States under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Fifth Amendment. The case was assigned to Judge Trina L. Thompson.\n\nThe complaint provided extensive background on the TPS program\u2019s purpose and statutory framework. Congress created TPS in 1990 to replace politically driven discretionary programs like \u201cextended voluntary departure\u201d with decisions based on clear humanitarian standards. TPS designations confer work authorization and protection from deportation. By statute, the Secretary must review country conditions before terminating any designation, with extensions effectively the default absent timely notice. Honduras and Nicaragua were designated in 1999 following Hurricane Mitch; Nepal in 2015 after a major earthquake. These designations were repeatedly extended due to ongoing humanitarian crises.\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, DHS announced TPS terminations between 2017 and 2018, affecting over 400,000 people. Federal courts blocked those terminations, finding they stemmed from a predetermined agenda to end TPS and were tainted by discriminatory animus against non-white immigrants. DHS rescinded those terminations in 2023.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that the second Trump administration renewed this agenda under Executive Order 14159, titled \u201cProtecting the American People Against Invasion,\u201d which directed DHS to rescind prior TPS-related policies and prioritize the removal of non-citizens. Plaintiffs asserted that Secretary Noem\u2019s TPS terminations were preordained, based on a superficial review, and motivated by racial and national-origin animus, citing public statements by Noem, President Trump, and Vice President Vance. Plaintiffs challenged the truncated 60-day transition period\u2014the minimum statutory notice before TPS termination became effective, a significant departure from historical practice\u2014as violating the equal protection guarantee implicit in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and alleged that DHS breached statutory requirements and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nRepresented by nonprofit immigrant rights attorneys, plaintiffs sought an injunction barring DHS from enforcing the terminations and an order maintaining TPS protections. They also sought to have the court set aside, postpone, or stay the terminations, enjoin enforcement, and award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, Judge Thompson granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to expedite briefing and hearing on their request to postpone the effective date of the TPS terminations.\n\nOn July 31, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to postpone the effective date of the TPS terminations for Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal until a hearing on the merits scheduled for November 18, 2025. In its order, the court wrote, \u201cThe freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood. The Court disagrees.\u201d\n\nThe court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the TPS terminations were preordained and not based on an objective assessment of country conditions. The court cited comments made by Secretary Noem before she reviewed any country conditions reports, which suggested a predetermined intent to end the TPS program. The court also found that the terminations failed to address data previously considered relevant, including political violence and crime in Honduras and recurring weather events in Nicaragua. The court determined that terminating TPS would cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs and that the balance of harms and the public interest weighed in favor of postponement. Judge Thompson concluded that the court had jurisdiction to review the case and that the requested relief to postpone the terminations fell within the scope of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThat same day, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the court\u2019s July 31 order. The defendants argued that they were likely to prevail on appeal, citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Noem v. National TPS Alliance, No. 25 cv 1766 EMC (N.D. Cal.), where the district court had erroneously concluded that the Secretary\u2019s action vacating a prior extension of TPS for certain Venezuelans exceeded her statutory authority. The defendants also contended that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief because the TPS statute explicitly barred judicial review of any decision to terminate a TPS designation. The defendants further argued that the balance of harms favored a stay, asserting that the government suffered irreparable harm when its policies were enjoined. Finally, the defendants maintained that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were without merit.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the defendants appealed the July 31 order to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case is about the federal government\u2019s termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. On July 7, 2025, the National TPS Alliance and private plaintiffs who are individual TPS holders filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), its Secretary, and the United States under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Fifth Amendment. The case was assigned to Judge Trina L. Thompson.\n\nThe complaint provided extensive background on the TPS program\u2019s purpose and statutory framework. Congress created TPS in 1990 to replace politically driven discretionary programs like \u201cextended voluntary departure\u201d with decisions based on clear humanitarian standards. TPS designations confer work authorization and protection from deportation. By statute, the Secretary must review country conditions before terminating any designation, with extensions effectively the default absent timely notice. Honduras and Nicaragua were designated in 1999 following Hurricane Mitch; Nepal in 2015 after a major earthquake. These designations were repeatedly extended due to ongoing humanitarian crises.\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, DHS announced TPS terminations between 2017 and 2018, affecting over 400,000 people. Federal courts blocked those terminations, finding they stemmed from a predetermined agenda to end TPS and were tainted by discriminatory animus against non-white immigrants. DHS rescinded those terminations in 2023.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that the second Trump administration renewed this agenda under Executive Order 14159, titled \u201cProtecting the American People Against Invasion,\u201d which directed DHS to rescind prior TPS-related policies and prioritize the removal of non-citizens. Plaintiffs asserted that Secretary Noem\u2019s TPS terminations were preordained, based on a superficial review, and motivated by racial and national-origin animus, citing public statements by Noem, President Trump, and Vice President Vance. Plaintiffs challenged the truncated 60-day transition period\u2014the minimum statutory notice before TPS termination became effective, a significant departure from historical practice\u2014as violating the equal protection guarantee implicit in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and alleged that DHS breached statutory requirements and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nRepresented by nonprofit immigrant rights attorneys, plaintiffs sought an injunction barring DHS from enforcing the terminations and an order maintaining TPS protections. They also sought to have the court set aside, postpone, or stay the terminations, enjoin enforcement, and award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, Judge Thompson granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to expedite briefing and hearing on their request to postpone the effective date of the TPS terminations.\n\nOn July 31, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to postpone the effective date of the TPS terminations for Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal until a hearing on the merits scheduled for November 18, 2025. In its order, the court wrote, \u201cThe freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood. The Court disagrees.\u201d\n\nThe court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the TPS terminations were preordained and not based on an objective assessment of country conditions. The court cited comments made by Secretary Noem before she reviewed any country conditions reports, which suggested a predetermined intent to end the TPS program. The court also found that the terminations failed to address data previously considered relevant, including political violence and crime in Honduras and recurring weather events in Nicaragua. The court determined that terminating TPS would cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs and that the balance of harms and the public interest weighed in favor of postponement. Judge Thompson concluded that the court had jurisdiction to review the case and that the requested relief to postpone the terminations fell within the scope of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThat same day, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the court\u2019s July 31 order. The defendants argued that they were likely to prevail on appeal, citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Noem v. National TPS Alliance, No. 25 cv 1766 EMC (N.D. Cal.), where the district court had erroneously concluded that the Secretary\u2019s action vacating a prior extension of TPS for certain Venezuelans exceeded her statutory authority. The defendants also contended that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief because the TPS statute explicitly barred judicial review of any decision to terminate a TPS designation. The defendants further argued that the balance of harms favored a stay, asserting that the government suffered irreparable harm when its policies were enjoined. Finally, the defendants maintained that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were without merit.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the defendants appealed the July 31 order to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

Congress created TPS in 1990 to replace politically driven discretionary programs like \u201cextended voluntary departure\u201d with decisions based on clear humanitarian standards. TPS designations confer work authorization and protection from deportation. By statute, the Secretary must review country conditions before terminating any designation, with extensions effectively the default absent timely notice. Honduras and Nicaragua were designated in 1999 following Hurricane Mitch; Nepal in 2015 after a major earthquake. These designations were repeatedly extended due to ongoing humanitarian crises.\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, DHS announced TPS terminations between 2017 and 2018, affecting over 400,000 people. Federal courts blocked those terminations, finding they stemmed from a predetermined agenda to end TPS and were tainted by discriminatory animus against non-white immigrants. DHS rescinded those terminations in 2023.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that the second Trump administration renewed this agenda under Executive Order 14159, titled \u201cProtecting the American People Against Invasion,\u201d which directed DHS to rescind prior TPS-related policies and prioritize the removal of non-citizens. Plaintiffs asserted that Secretary Noem\u2019s TPS terminations were preordained, based on a superficial review, and motivated by racial and national-origin animus, citing public statements by Noem, President Trump, and Vice President Vance. Plaintiffs challenged the truncated 60-day transition period\u2014the minimum statutory notice before TPS termination became effective, a significant departure from historical practice\u2014as violating the equal protection guarantee implicit in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and alleged that DHS breached statutory requirements and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nRepresented by nonprofit immigrant rights attorneys, plaintiffs sought an injunction barring DHS from enforcing the terminations and an order maintaining TPS protections. They also sought to have the court set aside, postpone, or stay the terminations, enjoin enforcement, and award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, Judge Thompson granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to expedite briefing and hearing on their request to postpone the effective date of the TPS terminations.\n\nOn July 31, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to postpone the effective date of the TPS terminations for Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal until a hearing on the merits scheduled for November 18, 2025. In its order, the court wrote, \u201cThe freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood. The Court disagrees.\u201d\n\nThe court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the TPS terminations were preordained and not based on an objective assessment of country conditions. The court cited comments made by Secretary Noem before she reviewed any country conditions reports, which suggested a predetermined intent to end the TPS program. The court also found that the terminations failed to address data previously considered relevant, including political violence and crime in Honduras and recurring weather events in Nicaragua. The court determined that terminating TPS would cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs and that the balance of harms and the public interest weighed in favor of postponement. Judge Thompson concluded that the court had jurisdiction to review the case and that the requested relief to postpone the terminations fell within the scope of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThat same day, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the court\u2019s July 31 order. The defendants argued that they were likely to prevail on appeal, citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Noem v. National TPS Alliance, No. 25 cv 1766 EMC (N.D. Cal.), where the district court had erroneously concluded that the Secretary\u2019s action vacating a prior extension of TPS for certain Venezuelans exceeded her statutory authority. The defendants also contended that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief because the TPS statute explicitly barred judicial review of any decision to terminate a TPS designation. The defendants further argued that the balance of harms favored a stay, asserting that the government suffered irreparable harm when its policies were enjoined. Finally, the defendants maintained that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were without merit.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the defendants appealed the July 31 order to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

Congress created TPS in 1990 to replace politically driven discretionary programs like \u201cextended voluntary departure\u201d with decisions based on clear humanitarian standards. TPS designations confer work authorization and protection from deportation. By statute, the Secretary must review country conditions before terminating any designation, with extensions effectively the default absent timely notice. Honduras and Nicaragua were designated in 1999 following Hurricane Mitch; Nepal in 2015 after a major earthquake. These designations were repeatedly extended due to ongoing humanitarian crises.\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, DHS announced TPS terminations between 2017 and 2018, affecting over 400,000 people. Federal courts blocked those terminations, finding they stemmed from a predetermined agenda to end TPS and were tainted by discriminatory animus against non-white immigrants. DHS rescinded those terminations in 2023.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that the second Trump administration renewed this agenda under Executive Order 14159, titled \u201cProtecting the American People Against Invasion,\u201d which directed DHS to rescind prior TPS-related policies and prioritize the removal of non-citizens. Plaintiffs asserted that Secretary Noem\u2019s TPS terminations were preordained, based on a superficial review, and motivated by racial and national-origin animus, citing public statements by Noem, President Trump, and Vice President Vance. Plaintiffs challenged the truncated 60-day transition period\u2014the minimum statutory notice before TPS termination became effective, a significant departure from historical practice\u2014as violating the equal protection guarantee implicit in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and alleged that DHS breached statutory requirements and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nRepresented by nonprofit immigrant rights attorneys, plaintiffs sought an injunction barring DHS from enforcing the terminations and an order maintaining TPS protections. They also sought to have the court set aside, postpone, or stay the terminations, enjoin enforcement, and award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, Judge Thompson granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to expedite briefing and hearing on their request to postpone the effective date of the TPS terminations.\n\nOn July 31, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to postpone the effective date of the TPS terminations for Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal until a hearing on the merits scheduled for November 18, 2025. In its order, the court wrote, \u201cThe freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood. The Court disagrees.\u201d\n\nThe court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the TPS terminations were preordained and not based on an objective assessment of country conditions. The court cited comments made by Secretary Noem before she reviewed any country conditions reports, which suggested a predetermined intent to end the TPS program. The court also found that the terminations failed to address data previously considered relevant, including political violence and crime in Honduras and recurring weather events in Nicaragua. The court determined that terminating TPS would cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs and that the balance of harms and the public interest weighed in favor of postponement. Judge Thompson concluded that the court had jurisdiction to review the case and that the requested relief to postpone the terminations fell within the scope of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThat same day, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the court\u2019s July 31 order. The defendants argued that they were likely to prevail on appeal, citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Noem v. National TPS Alliance, No. 25 cv 1766 EMC (N.D. Cal.), where the district court had erroneously concluded that the Secretary\u2019s action vacating a prior extension of TPS for certain Venezuelans exceeded her statutory authority. The defendants also contended that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief because the TPS statute explicitly barred judicial review of any decision to terminate a TPS designation. The defendants further argued that the balance of harms favored a stay, asserting that the government suffered irreparable harm when its policies were enjoined. Finally, the defendants maintained that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were without merit.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the defendants appealed the July 31 order to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",
