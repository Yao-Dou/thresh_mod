    "target": "This case challenged the decision of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to terminate plaintiffs\u2019 environmental grants without notice or substantive reason. These grants, awarded in 2024 under the Biden Administration, comprised $8 million given directly to each plaintiff and access to a further $52 million for plaintiffs to distribute among other community-based environmental initiatives in their respective cities. In February 2025\u2014under the Trump Administration\u2014plaintiffs each received notices that their grants had been terminated. These notices of termination were strictly boilerplate and did not include any specific allegations of wrongdoing on the part of plaintiffs; plaintiffs thus alleged the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and due process. Included in this boilerplate was an EPA \u201cpriority\u201d that it withhold funds from groups that participate in DEI initiatives; plaintiffs alleged that this violated the Clean Water Act\u2019s requirement that grant funds be used to aid underserved communities. Plaintiffs also alleged that it was a violation of the First Amendment for the Trump Administration to terminate their grants based on a difference of views regarding DEI initiatives.\n\nPlaintiffs, three nonprofit and philanthropic organizations, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on April 2, 2025. Plaintiffs are based in Baltimore, Minneapolis, and Seattle. The lawsuit named the EPA and its Administrator, Lee Zeldin, as defendants. Plaintiffs sought postponement and setting aside of the grant terminations under the APA; a declaration that the Clean Air Act prevented the EPA from choosing to withhold funds from DEI-friendly organizations; a declaration that the grant terminations were unconstitutional; a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring the EPA to reinstate plaintiffs\u2019 terminated grants and preventing it from terminating or suspending any funding to plaintiffs; and attorneys\u2019 fees. The case was assigned to Judge Adam B. Abelson.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, the court granted plaintiffs summary judgment with respect to their APA claims, setting aside the EPA\u2019s termination of their grants. The court found that even though the EPA possessed some discretion to advance its policy agenda, it was not allowed to disregard statutory requirements surrounding the grant program. Moreover, even if the agency could so contradict the expressed will of Congress, the court held that the EPA's failure to supply adequate justification for its course of action required it to set aside the grant terminations. The court declined to reach plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims. This constituted the final judgment of the district court.\n\nDefendants appealed the district court's summary judgment to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on July 16, 2025.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged the decision of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to terminate plaintiffs\u2019 environmental grants without notice or substantive reason. These grants, awarded in 2024 under the Biden Administration, comprised $8 million given directly to each plaintiff and access to a further $52 million for plaintiffs to distribute among other community-based environmental initiatives in their respective cities. In February 2025\u2014under the Trump Administration\u2014plaintiffs each received notices that their grants had been terminated. These notices of termination were strictly boilerplate and did not include any specific allegations of wrongdoing on the part of plaintiffs; plaintiffs thus alleged the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and due process. Included in this boilerplate was an EPA \u201cpriority\u201d that it withhold funds from groups that participate in DEI initiatives; plaintiffs alleged that this violated the Clean Water Act\u2019s requirement that grant funds be used to aid underserved communities. Plaintiffs also alleged that it was a violation of the First Amendment for the Trump Administration to terminate their grants based on a difference of views regarding DEI initiatives.\n\nPlaintiffs, three nonprofit and philanthropic organizations, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on April 2, 2025. Plaintiffs are based in Baltimore, Minneapolis, and Seattle. The lawsuit named the EPA and its Administrator, Lee Zeldin, as defendants. Plaintiffs sought postponement and setting aside of the grant terminations under the APA; a declaration that the Clean Air Act prevented the EPA from choosing to withhold funds from DEI-friendly organizations; a declaration that the grant terminations were unconstitutional; a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring the EPA to reinstate plaintiffs\u2019 terminated grants and preventing it from terminating or suspending any funding to plaintiffs; and attorneys\u2019 fees. The case was assigned to Judge Adam B. Abelson.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, the court granted plaintiffs summary judgment with respect to their APA claims, setting aside the EPA\u2019s termination of their grants. The court found that even though the EPA possessed some discretion to advance its policy agenda, it was not allowed to disregard statutory requirements surrounding the grant program. Moreover, even if the agency could so contradict the expressed will of Congress, the court held that the EPA's failure to supply adequate justification for its course of action required it to set aside the grant terminations. The court declined to reach plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims. This constituted the final judgment of the district court.\n\nDefendants appealed the district court's summary judgment to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on July 16, 2025.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged the decision of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to terminate plaintiffs\u2019 environmental grants without notice or substantive reason. These grants, awarded in 2024 under the Biden Administration, comprised $8 million given directly to each plaintiff and access to a further $52 million for plaintiffs to distribute among other community-based environmental initiatives in their respective cities. In February 2025\u2014under the Trump Administration\u2014plaintiffs each received notices that their grants had been terminated. These notices of termination were strictly boilerplate and did not include any specific allegations of wrongdoing on the part of plaintiffs; plaintiffs thus alleged the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and due process. Included in this boilerplate was an EPA \u201cpriority\u201d that it withhold funds from groups that participate in DEI initiatives; plaintiffs alleged that this violated the Clean Water Act\u2019s requirement that grant funds be used to aid underserved communities. Plaintiffs also alleged that it was a violation of the First Amendment for the Trump Administration to terminate their grants based on a difference of views regarding DEI initiatives.\n\nPlaintiffs, three nonprofit and philanthropic organizations, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on April 2, 2025. Plaintiffs are based in Baltimore, Minneapolis, and Seattle. The lawsuit named the EPA and its Administrator, Lee Zeldin, as defendants. Plaintiffs sought postponement and setting aside of the grant terminations under the APA; a declaration that the Clean Air Act prevented the EPA from choosing to withhold funds from DEI-friendly organizations; a declaration that the grant terminations were unconstitutional; a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring the EPA to reinstate plaintiffs\u2019 terminated grants and preventing it from terminating or suspending any funding to plaintiffs; and attorneys\u2019 fees. The case was assigned to Judge Adam B. Abelson.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, the court granted plaintiffs summary judgment with respect to their APA claims, setting aside the EPA\u2019s termination of their grants. The court found that even though the EPA possessed some discretion to advance its policy agenda, it was not allowed to disregard statutory requirements surrounding the grant program. Moreover, even if the agency could so contradict the expressed will of Congress, the court held that the EPA's failure to supply adequate justification for its course of action required it to set aside the grant terminations. The court declined to reach plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims. This constituted the final judgment of the district court.\n\nDefendants appealed the district court's summary judgment to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on July 16, 2025.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",
