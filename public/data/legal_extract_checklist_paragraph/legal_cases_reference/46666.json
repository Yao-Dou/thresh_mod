    "target": "This case is about the alleged unlawful termination, suspension, or reduction of federal research grants to University of California researchers under a series of executive orders issued by President Trump and directives from the Department of Governmental Ethics (DOGE). On June 4, 2025, a group of University of California researchers, faculty, staff, academic appointees, and employees filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Trump, DOGE, and numerous federal agencies, departments, and their heads. Judge Rita F. Lin was assigned to the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that these grant-related actions (1) exceeded presidential and agency authority in violation of the Separation of Powers, (2) infringed on academic freedom and free expression in violation of the First Amendment, (3) deprived them of due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment, (4) violated statutory limitations on executive spending authority under the Impoundment Control Act, and (5) constituted arbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the enforcement of the challenged executive orders and directives, as well as reinstatement of their research funding and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n\nOn June 5, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order to stop the defendants from taking any further actions to unlawfully terminate federal research grants. Specifically, the plaintiffs asked the court to restore their previously awarded grants, provide no-cost extensions for the time necessary to complete their interrupted work, and require the defendants to return to their lawful grant procedures from before January 20, 2025. These procedures included providing plaintiffs with reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard before termination, as well as a specific, individualized explanation for any proposed termination. The motion also sought to compel the defendants to file declarations verifying their compliance with the court's order.\n\nAlso on June 5, 2025, the plalintiffs moved for class certification, seeking to represent a proposed class of \u201cAll University of California researchers, including faculty, staff, academic appointees, and employees across the University of California system whose research grants have been or will be terminated, denied, suspended, or reduced\u201d by the defendants pursuant to Executive Orders 14151, 14154, 14158, 14168, 14173, 14217, 14238, and/or 14222, or any other Trump Administration or DOGE directives issued on or after January 20, 2025.\n\nOn June 23, 2025, Judge Lin granted the motion for a preliminary injunction and provisional class certification, extending the injunction to all similarly situated University of California researchers. 2025 WL 1734471. The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims under the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act, noting that the defendants\u2019 actions showed signs of \"quintessential viewpoint discrimination\". The order immediately enjoined the Trump Administration, DOGE, and the involved federal agencies from giving effect to the vacated grant terminations and prohibited any future terminations that would meet the criteria of the certified classes. It also required that the defendants restore the grants to the plaintiffs, pending the resolution of the case.\n\nOn July 10, 2025, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The following day, they filed a motion in the Ninth Circuit seeking a partial stay of the district court\u2019s injunction, limited to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). They argued that the injunction was overly broad, that the First Amendment did not require the defendants to subsidize particular projects or to do so on a content-neutral basis, that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, and that the EPA\u2019s actions were unreviewable because they were committed to agency discretion by law. The defendants asserted that the injunction caused irreparable harm to the public fisc and the Executive Branch. The defendants did not seek a stay as to the National Science Foundation (NSF), which had no plans to re-terminate grants during the appeal.\n\nBack in the district court, on July 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added two University of California researchers whose work was affected by the terminated grants as plaintiffs. The amended filing also sought to add the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Transportation as defendants. The filing included concrete examples, identifying specific projects and their details to support the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of widespread and unlawful grant terminations, such as the termination of an NSF grant supplement commemorating the agency\u2019s 75th anniversary. It also added new information about the Department of Energy, noting that the agency would review 179 awards totaling more than $15 billion to ensure consistency with the Trump Administration\u2019s policies and priorities.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit heard oral argument on the preliminary injunction appeal on July 31, 2025.\n\nIn the district court, on August 1, 2025, the plaintiffs moved to extend the injunction to the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation and to certify new classes of plaintiffs, introduced in the amended complaint, whose grants had been terminated by those agencies.\n\nOn August 4, 2025, in a letter brief to the court, the plaintiffs alleged that NSF had violated the June 23 preliminary injunction by indefinitely suspending hundreds of grants to UCLA researchers is a \"de facto termination\" and a \"brazen end-around\" the court's order. The letter stated that the NSF's July 30, 2025, letter to UCLA's Chancellor had suspended the grants because they were \"not aligned with current NSF priorities and/or programmatic goals,\" which the plaintiffs argued was \"indistinguishable\" from the form termination letters that the court had already deemed insufficient under the Administrative Procedure Act. An August 1, 2025, letter from the NSF further accused UCLA of noncompliance with federal statutes and regulations, citing its \"affirmative action\" policies, its failure to combat \"antisemitism and bias,\" and its allowance of transgender athletes in women's sports. The plaintiffs argued that these actions violated the First Amendment and constituted an attempt to \"penalize disfavored viewpoints.\" The letter also highlighted that the NSF had not sought a stay of the preliminary injunction and, in fact, that its attorney had told the Ninth Circuit that the NSF did not want to terminate grants, reinstate them, and then terminate them again\u2014an assertion the plaintiffs believed misrepresented their intent.\n\nThe defendants argued that the June 23 preliminary injunction should not be extended to cover the suspension of grants to UCLA. They contended that the factual and legal basis for the suspensions was fundamentally different from the terminations at issue in the original injunction. They stated that the suspensions were based on an investigation into UCLA's alleged discriminatory practices, not on a keyword-based termination of \"equity-related\" grants. The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the suspensions because none of the named plaintiffs had their grants suspended for the reasons cited in the NSF's letters. Furthermore, they asserted that the court lacked jurisdiction to modify the injunction, as it would \"materially alter the core questions of the case on appeal\" by requiring a new analysis of different claims and facts. The brief also highlighted that the suspensions were a temporary action, not a permanent termination, and that the NSF was willing to work with UCLA to bring them into compliance to prevent termination.\n\nThe following day, the court issued an order to show cause and set a hearing in the district court for August 12, 2025. After the hearing, the court ordered the NSF to vacate the grant suspensions and restore the affected class members to the status quo by reinstating their grants. The court found that the NSF\u2019s use of \u201csuspension\u201d was indistinguishable from a termination, which the preliminary injunction prohibited. The court clarified that \u201ctermination\u201d encompassed long-term or indefinite funding cuts, such as the NSF\u2019s suspensions. The court also held that the NSF\u2019s letters lacked grant-specific reasons for the cuts and failed to explain how researchers\u2019 reliance interests were considered. Although the letters included boilerplate language on reliance interests, they contained no individualized analysis of harm to researchers.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion to partially stay the June 23 preliminary injunction, finding that the defendants were unlikely to succeed on the merits, the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act, the plaintiffs had standing, and that the grant terminations were likely arbitrary, capricious, and viewpoint-based under the First Amendment. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 claims of irreparable harm, reasoning that stopping unlawful practices did not qualify. By contrast, the court found that a stay would cause serious harm to the plaintiffs, including layoffs, program disruptions, and the loss of research. Finally, ithe court determined that the public interest weighed against halting taxpayer-funded projects already underway.\n\nThis case is ongoing, with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s August 21 decision allowing grant funding to continue while the defendants\u2019 appeal of the injunction proceeds.",

These procedures included providing plaintiffs with reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard before termination, as well as a specific, individualized explanation for any proposed termination. The motion also sought to compel the defendants to file declarations verifying their compliance with the court's order.\n\nAlso on June 5, 2025, the plalintiffs moved for class certification, seeking to represent a proposed class of \u201cAll University of California researchers, including faculty, staff, academic appointees, and employees across the University of California system whose research grants have been or will be terminated, denied, suspended, or reduced\u201d by the defendants pursuant to Executive Orders 14151, 14154, 14158, 14168, 14173, 14217, 14238, and/or 14222, or any other Trump Administration or DOGE directives issued on or after January 20, 2025.\n\nOn June 23, 2025, Judge Lin granted the motion for a preliminary injunction and provisional class certification, extending the injunction to all similarly situated University of California researchers. 2025 WL 1734471.

It also required that the defendants restore the grants to the plaintiffs, pending the resolution of the case.\n\nOn July 10, 2025, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The following day, they filed a motion in the Ninth Circuit seeking a partial stay of the district court\u2019s injunction, limited to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). They argued that the injunction was overly broad, that the First Amendment did not require the defendants to subsidize particular projects or to do so on a content-neutral basis, that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, and that the EPA\u2019s actions were unreviewable because they were committed to agency discretion by law. The defendants asserted that the injunction caused irreparable harm to the public fisc and the Executive Branch. The defendants did not seek a stay as to the National Science Foundation (NSF), which had no plans to re-terminate grants during the appeal.\n\nBack in the district court, on July 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added two University of California researchers whose work was affected by the terminated grants as plaintiffs. The amended filing also sought to add the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Transportation as defendants. The filing included concrete examples, identifying specific projects and their details to support the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of widespread and unlawful grant terminations, such as the termination of an NSF grant supplement commemorating the agency\u2019s 75th anniversary. It also added new information about the Department of Energy, noting that the agency would review 179 awards totaling more than $15 billion to ensure consistency with the Trump Administration\u2019s policies and priorities.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit heard oral argument on the preliminary injunction appeal on July 31, 2025.\n\nIn the district court, on August 1, 2025, the plaintiffs moved to extend the injunction to the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation and to certify new classes of plaintiffs, introduced in the amended complaint, whose grants had been terminated by those agencies.\n\nOn August 4, 2025, in a letter brief to the court, the plaintiffs alleged that NSF had violated the June 23 preliminary injunction by indefinitely suspending hundreds of grants to UCLA researchers is a \"de facto termination\" and a \"brazen end-around\" the court's order.

They contended that the factual and legal basis for the suspensions was fundamentally different from the terminations at issue in the original injunction. They stated that the suspensions were based on an investigation into UCLA's alleged discriminatory practices, not on a keyword-based termination of \"equity-related\" grants. The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the suspensions because none of the named plaintiffs had their grants suspended for the reasons cited in the NSF's letters.

The brief also highlighted that the suspensions were a temporary action, not a permanent termination, and that the NSF was willing to work with UCLA to bring them into compliance to prevent termination.\n\nThe following day, the court issued an order to show cause and set a hearing in the district court for August 12, 2025. After the hearing, the court ordered the NSF to vacate the grant suspensions and restore the affected class members to the status quo by reinstating their grants. The court found that the NSF\u2019s use of \u201csuspension\u201d was indistinguishable from a termination, which the preliminary injunction prohibited. The court clarified that \u201ctermination\u201d encompassed long-term or indefinite funding cuts, such as the NSF\u2019s suspensions.

    "target": "This case is about the alleged unlawful termination, suspension, or reduction of federal research grants to University of California researchers under a series of executive orders issued by President Trump and directives from the Department of Governmental Ethics (DOGE). On June 4, 2025, a group of University of California researchers, faculty, staff, academic appointees, and employees filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Trump, DOGE, and numerous federal agencies, departments, and their heads. Judge Rita F. Lin was assigned to the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that these grant-related actions (1) exceeded presidential and agency authority in violation of the Separation of Powers, (2) infringed on academic freedom and free expression in violation of the First Amendment, (3) deprived them of due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment, (4) violated statutory limitations on executive spending authority under the Impoundment Control Act, and (5) constituted arbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the enforcement of the challenged executive orders and directives, as well as reinstatement of their research funding and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n\nOn June 5, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order to stop the defendants from taking any further actions to unlawfully terminate federal research grants. Specifically, the plaintiffs asked the court to restore their previously awarded grants, provide no-cost extensions for the time necessary to complete their interrupted work, and require the defendants to return to their lawful grant procedures from before January 20, 2025. These procedures included providing plaintiffs with reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard before termination, as well as a specific, individualized explanation for any proposed termination. The motion also sought to compel the defendants to file declarations verifying their compliance with the court's order.\n\nAlso on June 5, 2025, the plalintiffs moved for class certification, seeking to represent a proposed class of \u201cAll University of California researchers, including faculty, staff, academic appointees, and employees across the University of California system whose research grants have been or will be terminated, denied, suspended, or reduced\u201d by the defendants pursuant to Executive Orders 14151, 14154, 14158, 14168, 14173, 14217, 14238, and/or 14222, or any other Trump Administration or DOGE directives issued on or after January 20, 2025.\n\nOn June 23, 2025, Judge Lin granted the motion for a preliminary injunction and provisional class certification, extending the injunction to all similarly situated University of California researchers. 2025 WL 1734471. The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims under the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act, noting that the defendants\u2019 actions showed signs of \"quintessential viewpoint discrimination\". The order immediately enjoined the Trump Administration, DOGE, and the involved federal agencies from giving effect to the vacated grant terminations and prohibited any future terminations that would meet the criteria of the certified classes. It also required that the defendants restore the grants to the plaintiffs, pending the resolution of the case.\n\nOn July 10, 2025, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The following day, they filed a motion in the Ninth Circuit seeking a partial stay of the district court\u2019s injunction, limited to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). They argued that the injunction was overly broad, that the First Amendment did not require the defendants to subsidize particular projects or to do so on a content-neutral basis, that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, and that the EPA\u2019s actions were unreviewable because they were committed to agency discretion by law. The defendants asserted that the injunction caused irreparable harm to the public fisc and the Executive Branch. The defendants did not seek a stay as to the National Science Foundation (NSF), which had no plans to re-terminate grants during the appeal.\n\nBack in the district court, on July 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added two University of California researchers whose work was affected by the terminated grants as plaintiffs. The amended filing also sought to add the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Transportation as defendants. The filing included concrete examples, identifying specific projects and their details to support the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of widespread and unlawful grant terminations, such as the termination of an NSF grant supplement commemorating the agency\u2019s 75th anniversary. It also added new information about the Department of Energy, noting that the agency would review 179 awards totaling more than $15 billion to ensure consistency with the Trump Administration\u2019s policies and priorities.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit heard oral argument on the preliminary injunction appeal on July 31, 2025.\n\nIn the district court, on August 1, 2025, the plaintiffs moved to extend the injunction to the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation and to certify new classes of plaintiffs, introduced in the amended complaint, whose grants had been terminated by those agencies.\n\nOn August 4, 2025, in a letter brief to the court, the plaintiffs alleged that NSF had violated the June 23 preliminary injunction by indefinitely suspending hundreds of grants to UCLA researchers is a \"de facto termination\" and a \"brazen end-around\" the court's order. The letter stated that the NSF's July 30, 2025, letter to UCLA's Chancellor had suspended the grants because they were \"not aligned with current NSF priorities and/or programmatic goals,\" which the plaintiffs argued was \"indistinguishable\" from the form termination letters that the court had already deemed insufficient under the Administrative Procedure Act. An August 1, 2025, letter from the NSF further accused UCLA of noncompliance with federal statutes and regulations, citing its \"affirmative action\" policies, its failure to combat \"antisemitism and bias,\" and its allowance of transgender athletes in women's sports. The plaintiffs argued that these actions violated the First Amendment and constituted an attempt to \"penalize disfavored viewpoints.\" The letter also highlighted that the NSF had not sought a stay of the preliminary injunction and, in fact, that its attorney had told the Ninth Circuit that the NSF did not want to terminate grants, reinstate them, and then terminate them again\u2014an assertion the plaintiffs believed misrepresented their intent.\n\nThe defendants argued that the June 23 preliminary injunction should not be extended to cover the suspension of grants to UCLA. They contended that the factual and legal basis for the suspensions was fundamentally different from the terminations at issue in the original injunction. They stated that the suspensions were based on an investigation into UCLA's alleged discriminatory practices, not on a keyword-based termination of \"equity-related\" grants. The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the suspensions because none of the named plaintiffs had their grants suspended for the reasons cited in the NSF's letters. Furthermore, they asserted that the court lacked jurisdiction to modify the injunction, as it would \"materially alter the core questions of the case on appeal\" by requiring a new analysis of different claims and facts. The brief also highlighted that the suspensions were a temporary action, not a permanent termination, and that the NSF was willing to work with UCLA to bring them into compliance to prevent termination.\n\nThe following day, the court issued an order to show cause and set a hearing in the district court for August 12, 2025. After the hearing, the court ordered the NSF to vacate the grant suspensions and restore the affected class members to the status quo by reinstating their grants. The court found that the NSF\u2019s use of \u201csuspension\u201d was indistinguishable from a termination, which the preliminary injunction prohibited. The court clarified that \u201ctermination\u201d encompassed long-term or indefinite funding cuts, such as the NSF\u2019s suspensions. The court also held that the NSF\u2019s letters lacked grant-specific reasons for the cuts and failed to explain how researchers\u2019 reliance interests were considered. Although the letters included boilerplate language on reliance interests, they contained no individualized analysis of harm to researchers.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion to partially stay the June 23 preliminary injunction, finding that the defendants were unlikely to succeed on the merits, the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act, the plaintiffs had standing, and that the grant terminations were likely arbitrary, capricious, and viewpoint-based under the First Amendment. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 claims of irreparable harm, reasoning that stopping unlawful practices did not qualify. By contrast, the court found that a stay would cause serious harm to the plaintiffs, including layoffs, program disruptions, and the loss of research. Finally, ithe court determined that the public interest weighed against halting taxpayer-funded projects already underway.\n\nThis case is ongoing, with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s August 21 decision allowing grant funding to continue while the defendants\u2019 appeal of the injunction proceeds.",

    "target": "This case is about the alleged unlawful termination, suspension, or reduction of federal research grants to University of California researchers under a series of executive orders issued by President Trump and directives from the Department of Governmental Ethics (DOGE). On June 4, 2025, a group of University of California researchers, faculty, staff, academic appointees, and employees filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Trump, DOGE, and numerous federal agencies, departments, and their heads. Judge Rita F. Lin was assigned to the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that these grant-related actions (1) exceeded presidential and agency authority in violation of the Separation of Powers, (2) infringed on academic freedom and free expression in violation of the First Amendment, (3) deprived them of due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment, (4) violated statutory limitations on executive spending authority under the Impoundment Control Act, and (5) constituted arbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the enforcement of the challenged executive orders and directives, as well as reinstatement of their research funding and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n\nOn June 5, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order to stop the defendants from taking any further actions to unlawfully terminate federal research grants. Specifically, the plaintiffs asked the court to restore their previously awarded grants, provide no-cost extensions for the time necessary to complete their interrupted work, and require the defendants to return to their lawful grant procedures from before January 20, 2025. These procedures included providing plaintiffs with reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard before termination, as well as a specific, individualized explanation for any proposed termination. The motion also sought to compel the defendants to file declarations verifying their compliance with the court's order.\n\nAlso on June 5, 2025, the plalintiffs moved for class certification, seeking to represent a proposed class of \u201cAll University of California researchers, including faculty, staff, academic appointees, and employees across the University of California system whose research grants have been or will be terminated, denied, suspended, or reduced\u201d by the defendants pursuant to Executive Orders 14151, 14154, 14158, 14168, 14173, 14217, 14238, and/or 14222, or any other Trump Administration or DOGE directives issued on or after January 20, 2025.\n\nOn June 23, 2025, Judge Lin granted the motion for a preliminary injunction and provisional class certification, extending the injunction to all similarly situated University of California researchers. 2025 WL 1734471. The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims under the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act, noting that the defendants\u2019 actions showed signs of \"quintessential viewpoint discrimination\". The order immediately enjoined the Trump Administration, DOGE, and the involved federal agencies from giving effect to the vacated grant terminations and prohibited any future terminations that would meet the criteria of the certified classes. It also required that the defendants restore the grants to the plaintiffs, pending the resolution of the case.\n\nOn July 10, 2025, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The following day, they filed a motion in the Ninth Circuit seeking a partial stay of the district court\u2019s injunction, limited to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). They argued that the injunction was overly broad, that the First Amendment did not require the defendants to subsidize particular projects or to do so on a content-neutral basis, that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, and that the EPA\u2019s actions were unreviewable because they were committed to agency discretion by law. The defendants asserted that the injunction caused irreparable harm to the public fisc and the Executive Branch. The defendants did not seek a stay as to the National Science Foundation (NSF), which had no plans to re-terminate grants during the appeal.\n\nBack in the district court, on July 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added two University of California researchers whose work was affected by the terminated grants as plaintiffs. The amended filing also sought to add the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Transportation as defendants. The filing included concrete examples, identifying specific projects and their details to support the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of widespread and unlawful grant terminations, such as the termination of an NSF grant supplement commemorating the agency\u2019s 75th anniversary. It also added new information about the Department of Energy, noting that the agency would review 179 awards totaling more than $15 billion to ensure consistency with the Trump Administration\u2019s policies and priorities.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit heard oral argument on the preliminary injunction appeal on July 31, 2025.\n\nIn the district court, on August 1, 2025, the plaintiffs moved to extend the injunction to the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation and to certify new classes of plaintiffs, introduced in the amended complaint, whose grants had been terminated by those agencies.\n\nOn August 4, 2025, in a letter brief to the court, the plaintiffs alleged that NSF had violated the June 23 preliminary injunction by indefinitely suspending hundreds of grants to UCLA researchers is a \"de facto termination\" and a \"brazen end-around\" the court's order. The letter stated that the NSF's July 30, 2025, letter to UCLA's Chancellor had suspended the grants because they were \"not aligned with current NSF priorities and/or programmatic goals,\" which the plaintiffs argued was \"indistinguishable\" from the form termination letters that the court had already deemed insufficient under the Administrative Procedure Act. An August 1, 2025, letter from the NSF further accused UCLA of noncompliance with federal statutes and regulations, citing its \"affirmative action\" policies, its failure to combat \"antisemitism and bias,\" and its allowance of transgender athletes in women's sports. The plaintiffs argued that these actions violated the First Amendment and constituted an attempt to \"penalize disfavored viewpoints.\" The letter also highlighted that the NSF had not sought a stay of the preliminary injunction and, in fact, that its attorney had told the Ninth Circuit that the NSF did not want to terminate grants, reinstate them, and then terminate them again\u2014an assertion the plaintiffs believed misrepresented their intent.\n\nThe defendants argued that the June 23 preliminary injunction should not be extended to cover the suspension of grants to UCLA. They contended that the factual and legal basis for the suspensions was fundamentally different from the terminations at issue in the original injunction. They stated that the suspensions were based on an investigation into UCLA's alleged discriminatory practices, not on a keyword-based termination of \"equity-related\" grants. The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the suspensions because none of the named plaintiffs had their grants suspended for the reasons cited in the NSF's letters. Furthermore, they asserted that the court lacked jurisdiction to modify the injunction, as it would \"materially alter the core questions of the case on appeal\" by requiring a new analysis of different claims and facts. The brief also highlighted that the suspensions were a temporary action, not a permanent termination, and that the NSF was willing to work with UCLA to bring them into compliance to prevent termination.\n\nThe following day, the court issued an order to show cause and set a hearing in the district court for August 12, 2025. After the hearing, the court ordered the NSF to vacate the grant suspensions and restore the affected class members to the status quo by reinstating their grants. The court found that the NSF\u2019s use of \u201csuspension\u201d was indistinguishable from a termination, which the preliminary injunction prohibited. The court clarified that \u201ctermination\u201d encompassed long-term or indefinite funding cuts, such as the NSF\u2019s suspensions. The court also held that the NSF\u2019s letters lacked grant-specific reasons for the cuts and failed to explain how researchers\u2019 reliance interests were considered. Although the letters included boilerplate language on reliance interests, they contained no individualized analysis of harm to researchers.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion to partially stay the June 23 preliminary injunction, finding that the defendants were unlikely to succeed on the merits, the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act, the plaintiffs had standing, and that the grant terminations were likely arbitrary, capricious, and viewpoint-based under the First Amendment. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 claims of irreparable harm, reasoning that stopping unlawful practices did not qualify. By contrast, the court found that a stay would cause serious harm to the plaintiffs, including layoffs, program disruptions, and the loss of research. Finally, ithe court determined that the public interest weighed against halting taxpayer-funded projects already underway.\n\nThis case is ongoing, with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s August 21 decision allowing grant funding to continue while the defendants\u2019 appeal of the injunction proceeds.",

    "target": "This case is about the alleged unlawful termination, suspension, or reduction of federal research grants to University of California researchers under a series of executive orders issued by President Trump and directives from the Department of Governmental Ethics (DOGE). On June 4, 2025, a group of University of California researchers, faculty, staff, academic appointees, and employees filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Trump, DOGE, and numerous federal agencies, departments, and their heads. Judge Rita F. Lin was assigned to the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that these grant-related actions (1) exceeded presidential and agency authority in violation of the Separation of Powers, (2) infringed on academic freedom and free expression in violation of the First Amendment, (3) deprived them of due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment, (4) violated statutory limitations on executive spending authority under the Impoundment Control Act, and (5) constituted arbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the enforcement of the challenged executive orders and directives, as well as reinstatement of their research funding and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n\nOn June 5, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order to stop the defendants from taking any further actions to unlawfully terminate federal research grants. Specifically, the plaintiffs asked the court to restore their previously awarded grants, provide no-cost extensions for the time necessary to complete their interrupted work, and require the defendants to return to their lawful grant procedures from before January 20, 2025. These procedures included providing plaintiffs with reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard before termination, as well as a specific, individualized explanation for any proposed termination. The motion also sought to compel the defendants to file declarations verifying their compliance with the court's order.\n\nAlso on June 5, 2025, the plalintiffs moved for class certification, seeking to represent a proposed class of \u201cAll University of California researchers, including faculty, staff, academic appointees, and employees across the University of California system whose research grants have been or will be terminated, denied, suspended, or reduced\u201d by the defendants pursuant to Executive Orders 14151, 14154, 14158, 14168, 14173, 14217, 14238, and/or 14222, or any other Trump Administration or DOGE directives issued on or after January 20, 2025.\n\nOn June 23, 2025, Judge Lin granted the motion for a preliminary injunction and provisional class certification, extending the injunction to all similarly situated University of California researchers. 2025 WL 1734471. The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims under the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act, noting that the defendants\u2019 actions showed signs of \"quintessential viewpoint discrimination\". The order immediately enjoined the Trump Administration, DOGE, and the involved federal agencies from giving effect to the vacated grant terminations and prohibited any future terminations that would meet the criteria of the certified classes. It also required that the defendants restore the grants to the plaintiffs, pending the resolution of the case.\n\nOn July 10, 2025, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The following day, they filed a motion in the Ninth Circuit seeking a partial stay of the district court\u2019s injunction, limited to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). They argued that the injunction was overly broad, that the First Amendment did not require the defendants to subsidize particular projects or to do so on a content-neutral basis, that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, and that the EPA\u2019s actions were unreviewable because they were committed to agency discretion by law. The defendants asserted that the injunction caused irreparable harm to the public fisc and the Executive Branch. The defendants did not seek a stay as to the National Science Foundation (NSF), which had no plans to re-terminate grants during the appeal.\n\nBack in the district court, on July 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added two University of California researchers whose work was affected by the terminated grants as plaintiffs. The amended filing also sought to add the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Transportation as defendants. The filing included concrete examples, identifying specific projects and their details to support the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of widespread and unlawful grant terminations, such as the termination of an NSF grant supplement commemorating the agency\u2019s 75th anniversary. It also added new information about the Department of Energy, noting that the agency would review 179 awards totaling more than $15 billion to ensure consistency with the Trump Administration\u2019s policies and priorities.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit heard oral argument on the preliminary injunction appeal on July 31, 2025.\n\nIn the district court, on August 1, 2025, the plaintiffs moved to extend the injunction to the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation and to certify new classes of plaintiffs, introduced in the amended complaint, whose grants had been terminated by those agencies.\n\nOn August 4, 2025, in a letter brief to the court, the plaintiffs alleged that NSF had violated the June 23 preliminary injunction by indefinitely suspending hundreds of grants to UCLA researchers is a \"de facto termination\" and a \"brazen end-around\" the court's order. The letter stated that the NSF's July 30, 2025, letter to UCLA's Chancellor had suspended the grants because they were \"not aligned with current NSF priorities and/or programmatic goals,\" which the plaintiffs argued was \"indistinguishable\" from the form termination letters that the court had already deemed insufficient under the Administrative Procedure Act. An August 1, 2025, letter from the NSF further accused UCLA of noncompliance with federal statutes and regulations, citing its \"affirmative action\" policies, its failure to combat \"antisemitism and bias,\" and its allowance of transgender athletes in women's sports. The plaintiffs argued that these actions violated the First Amendment and constituted an attempt to \"penalize disfavored viewpoints.\" The letter also highlighted that the NSF had not sought a stay of the preliminary injunction and, in fact, that its attorney had told the Ninth Circuit that the NSF did not want to terminate grants, reinstate them, and then terminate them again\u2014an assertion the plaintiffs believed misrepresented their intent.\n\nThe defendants argued that the June 23 preliminary injunction should not be extended to cover the suspension of grants to UCLA. They contended that the factual and legal basis for the suspensions was fundamentally different from the terminations at issue in the original injunction. They stated that the suspensions were based on an investigation into UCLA's alleged discriminatory practices, not on a keyword-based termination of \"equity-related\" grants. The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the suspensions because none of the named plaintiffs had their grants suspended for the reasons cited in the NSF's letters. Furthermore, they asserted that the court lacked jurisdiction to modify the injunction, as it would \"materially alter the core questions of the case on appeal\" by requiring a new analysis of different claims and facts. The brief also highlighted that the suspensions were a temporary action, not a permanent termination, and that the NSF was willing to work with UCLA to bring them into compliance to prevent termination.\n\nThe following day, the court issued an order to show cause and set a hearing in the district court for August 12, 2025. After the hearing, the court ordered the NSF to vacate the grant suspensions and restore the affected class members to the status quo by reinstating their grants. The court found that the NSF\u2019s use of \u201csuspension\u201d was indistinguishable from a termination, which the preliminary injunction prohibited. The court clarified that \u201ctermination\u201d encompassed long-term or indefinite funding cuts, such as the NSF\u2019s suspensions. The court also held that the NSF\u2019s letters lacked grant-specific reasons for the cuts and failed to explain how researchers\u2019 reliance interests were considered. Although the letters included boilerplate language on reliance interests, they contained no individualized analysis of harm to researchers.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion to partially stay the June 23 preliminary injunction, finding that the defendants were unlikely to succeed on the merits, the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act, the plaintiffs had standing, and that the grant terminations were likely arbitrary, capricious, and viewpoint-based under the First Amendment. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 claims of irreparable harm, reasoning that stopping unlawful practices did not qualify. By contrast, the court found that a stay would cause serious harm to the plaintiffs, including layoffs, program disruptions, and the loss of research. Finally, ithe court determined that the public interest weighed against halting taxpayer-funded projects already underway.\n\nThis case is ongoing, with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s August 21 decision allowing grant funding to continue while the defendants\u2019 appeal of the injunction proceeds.",

Although the letters included boilerplate language on reliance interests, they contained no individualized analysis of harm to researchers.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion to partially stay the June 23 preliminary injunction, finding that the defendants were unlikely to succeed on the merits, the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act, the plaintiffs had standing, and that the grant terminations were likely arbitrary, capricious, and viewpoint-based under the First Amendment. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 claims of irreparable harm, reasoning that stopping unlawful practices did not qualify. By contrast, the court found that a stay would cause serious harm to the plaintiffs, including layoffs, program disruptions, and the loss of research. Finally, ithe court determined that the public interest weighed against halting taxpayer-funded projects already underway.\n\nThis case is ongoing, with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s August 21 decision allowing grant funding to continue while the defendants\u2019 appeal of the injunction proceeds.",

    "target": "This case is about the alleged unlawful termination, suspension, or reduction of federal research grants to University of California researchers under a series of executive orders issued by President Trump and directives from the Department of Governmental Ethics (DOGE). On June 4, 2025, a group of University of California researchers, faculty, staff, academic appointees, and employees filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Trump, DOGE, and numerous federal agencies, departments, and their heads. Judge Rita F. Lin was assigned to the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that these grant-related actions (1) exceeded presidential and agency authority in violation of the Separation of Powers, (2) infringed on academic freedom and free expression in violation of the First Amendment, (3) deprived them of due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment, (4) violated statutory limitations on executive spending authority under the Impoundment Control Act, and (5) constituted arbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the enforcement of the challenged executive orders and directives, as well as reinstatement of their research funding and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n\nOn June 5, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order to stop the defendants from taking any further actions to unlawfully terminate federal research grants. Specifically, the plaintiffs asked the court to restore their previously awarded grants, provide no-cost extensions for the time necessary to complete their interrupted work, and require the defendants to return to their lawful grant procedures from before January 20, 2025. These procedures included providing plaintiffs with reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard before termination, as well as a specific, individualized explanation for any proposed termination. The motion also sought to compel the defendants to file declarations verifying their compliance with the court's order.\n\nAlso on June 5, 2025, the plalintiffs moved for class certification, seeking to represent a proposed class of \u201cAll University of California researchers, including faculty, staff, academic appointees, and employees across the University of California system whose research grants have been or will be terminated, denied, suspended, or reduced\u201d by the defendants pursuant to Executive Orders 14151, 14154, 14158, 14168, 14173, 14217, 14238, and/or 14222, or any other Trump Administration or DOGE directives issued on or after January 20, 2025.\n\nOn June 23, 2025, Judge Lin granted the motion for a preliminary injunction and provisional class certification, extending the injunction to all similarly situated University of California researchers. 2025 WL 1734471. The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims under the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act, noting that the defendants\u2019 actions showed signs of \"quintessential viewpoint discrimination\". The order immediately enjoined the Trump Administration, DOGE, and the involved federal agencies from giving effect to the vacated grant terminations and prohibited any future terminations that would meet the criteria of the certified classes. It also required that the defendants restore the grants to the plaintiffs, pending the resolution of the case.\n\nOn July 10, 2025, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The following day, they filed a motion in the Ninth Circuit seeking a partial stay of the district court\u2019s injunction, limited to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). They argued that the injunction was overly broad, that the First Amendment did not require the defendants to subsidize particular projects or to do so on a content-neutral basis, that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, and that the EPA\u2019s actions were unreviewable because they were committed to agency discretion by law. The defendants asserted that the injunction caused irreparable harm to the public fisc and the Executive Branch. The defendants did not seek a stay as to the National Science Foundation (NSF), which had no plans to re-terminate grants during the appeal.\n\nBack in the district court, on July 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added two University of California researchers whose work was affected by the terminated grants as plaintiffs. The amended filing also sought to add the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Transportation as defendants. The filing included concrete examples, identifying specific projects and their details to support the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of widespread and unlawful grant terminations, such as the termination of an NSF grant supplement commemorating the agency\u2019s 75th anniversary. It also added new information about the Department of Energy, noting that the agency would review 179 awards totaling more than $15 billion to ensure consistency with the Trump Administration\u2019s policies and priorities.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit heard oral argument on the preliminary injunction appeal on July 31, 2025.\n\nIn the district court, on August 1, 2025, the plaintiffs moved to extend the injunction to the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation and to certify new classes of plaintiffs, introduced in the amended complaint, whose grants had been terminated by those agencies.\n\nOn August 4, 2025, in a letter brief to the court, the plaintiffs alleged that NSF had violated the June 23 preliminary injunction by indefinitely suspending hundreds of grants to UCLA researchers is a \"de facto termination\" and a \"brazen end-around\" the court's order. The letter stated that the NSF's July 30, 2025, letter to UCLA's Chancellor had suspended the grants because they were \"not aligned with current NSF priorities and/or programmatic goals,\" which the plaintiffs argued was \"indistinguishable\" from the form termination letters that the court had already deemed insufficient under the Administrative Procedure Act. An August 1, 2025, letter from the NSF further accused UCLA of noncompliance with federal statutes and regulations, citing its \"affirmative action\" policies, its failure to combat \"antisemitism and bias,\" and its allowance of transgender athletes in women's sports. The plaintiffs argued that these actions violated the First Amendment and constituted an attempt to \"penalize disfavored viewpoints.\" The letter also highlighted that the NSF had not sought a stay of the preliminary injunction and, in fact, that its attorney had told the Ninth Circuit that the NSF did not want to terminate grants, reinstate them, and then terminate them again\u2014an assertion the plaintiffs believed misrepresented their intent.\n\nThe defendants argued that the June 23 preliminary injunction should not be extended to cover the suspension of grants to UCLA. They contended that the factual and legal basis for the suspensions was fundamentally different from the terminations at issue in the original injunction. They stated that the suspensions were based on an investigation into UCLA's alleged discriminatory practices, not on a keyword-based termination of \"equity-related\" grants. The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the suspensions because none of the named plaintiffs had their grants suspended for the reasons cited in the NSF's letters. Furthermore, they asserted that the court lacked jurisdiction to modify the injunction, as it would \"materially alter the core questions of the case on appeal\" by requiring a new analysis of different claims and facts. The brief also highlighted that the suspensions were a temporary action, not a permanent termination, and that the NSF was willing to work with UCLA to bring them into compliance to prevent termination.\n\nThe following day, the court issued an order to show cause and set a hearing in the district court for August 12, 2025. After the hearing, the court ordered the NSF to vacate the grant suspensions and restore the affected class members to the status quo by reinstating their grants. The court found that the NSF\u2019s use of \u201csuspension\u201d was indistinguishable from a termination, which the preliminary injunction prohibited. The court clarified that \u201ctermination\u201d encompassed long-term or indefinite funding cuts, such as the NSF\u2019s suspensions. The court also held that the NSF\u2019s letters lacked grant-specific reasons for the cuts and failed to explain how researchers\u2019 reliance interests were considered.

Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the enforcement of the challenged executive orders and directives, as well as reinstatement of their research funding and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n\nOn June 5, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order to stop the defendants from taking any further actions to unlawfully terminate federal research grants. Specifically, the plaintiffs asked the court to restore their previously awarded grants, provide no-cost extensions for the time necessary to complete their interrupted work, and require the defendants to return to their lawful grant procedures from before January 20, 2025. These procedures included providing plaintiffs with reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard before termination, as well as a specific, individualized explanation for any proposed termination. The motion also sought to compel the defendants to file declarations verifying their compliance with the court's order.\n\nAlso on June 5, 2025, the plalintiffs moved for class certification, seeking to represent a proposed class of \u201cAll University of California researchers, including faculty, staff, academic appointees, and employees across the University of California system whose research grants have been or will be terminated, denied, suspended, or reduced\u201d by the defendants pursuant to Executive Orders 14151, 14154, 14158, 14168, 14173, 14217, 14238, and/or 14222, or any other Trump Administration or DOGE directives issued on or after January 20, 2025.\n\nOn June 23, 2025, Judge Lin granted the motion for a preliminary injunction and provisional class certification, extending the injunction to all similarly situated University of California researchers. 2025 WL 1734471. The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims under the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act, noting that the defendants\u2019 actions showed signs of \"quintessential viewpoint discrimination\". The order immediately enjoined the Trump Administration, DOGE, and the involved federal agencies from giving effect to the vacated grant terminations and prohibited any future terminations that would meet the criteria of the certified classes. It also required that the defendants restore the grants to the plaintiffs, pending the resolution of the case.\n\nOn July 10, 2025, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The following day, they filed a motion in the Ninth Circuit seeking a partial stay of the district court\u2019s injunction, limited to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). They argued that the injunction was overly broad, that the First Amendment did not require the defendants to subsidize particular projects or to do so on a content-neutral basis, that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, and that the EPA\u2019s actions were unreviewable because they were committed to agency discretion by law. The defendants asserted that the injunction caused irreparable harm to the public fisc and the Executive Branch. The defendants did not seek a stay as to the National Science Foundation (NSF), which had no plans to re-terminate grants during the appeal.\n\nBack in the district court, on July 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added two University of California researchers whose work was affected by the terminated grants as plaintiffs. The amended filing also sought to add the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Transportation as defendants. The filing included concrete examples, identifying specific projects and their details to support the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of widespread and unlawful grant terminations, such as the termination of an NSF grant supplement commemorating the agency\u2019s 75th anniversary. It also added new information about the Department of Energy, noting that the agency would review 179 awards totaling more than $15 billion to ensure consistency with the Trump Administration\u2019s policies and priorities.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit heard oral argument on the preliminary injunction appeal on July 31, 2025.\n\nIn the district court, on August 1, 2025, the plaintiffs moved to extend the injunction to the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation and to certify new classes of plaintiffs, introduced in the amended complaint, whose grants had been terminated by those agencies.\n\nOn August 4, 2025, in a letter brief to the court, the plaintiffs alleged that NSF had violated the June 23 preliminary injunction by indefinitely suspending hundreds of grants to UCLA researchers is a \"de facto termination\" and a \"brazen end-around\" the court's order. The letter stated that the NSF's July 30, 2025, letter to UCLA's Chancellor had suspended the grants because they were \"not aligned with current NSF priorities and/or programmatic goals,\" which the plaintiffs argued was \"indistinguishable\" from the form termination letters that the court had already deemed insufficient under the Administrative Procedure Act. An August 1, 2025, letter from the NSF further accused UCLA of noncompliance with federal statutes and regulations, citing its \"affirmative action\" policies, its failure to combat \"antisemitism and bias,\" and its allowance of transgender athletes in women's sports. The plaintiffs argued that these actions violated the First Amendment and constituted an attempt to \"penalize disfavored viewpoints.\" The letter also highlighted that the NSF had not sought a stay of the preliminary injunction and, in fact, that its attorney had told the Ninth Circuit that the NSF did not want to terminate grants, reinstate them, and then terminate them again\u2014an assertion the plaintiffs believed misrepresented their intent.\n\nThe defendants argued that the June 23 preliminary injunction should not be extended to cover the suspension of grants to UCLA. They contended that the factual and legal basis for the suspensions was fundamentally different from the terminations at issue in the original injunction. They stated that the suspensions were based on an investigation into UCLA's alleged discriminatory practices, not on a keyword-based termination of \"equity-related\" grants. The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the suspensions because none of the named plaintiffs had their grants suspended for the reasons cited in the NSF's letters. Furthermore, they asserted that the court lacked jurisdiction to modify the injunction, as it would \"materially alter the core questions of the case on appeal\" by requiring a new analysis of different claims and facts. The brief also highlighted that the suspensions were a temporary action, not a permanent termination, and that the NSF was willing to work with UCLA to bring them into compliance to prevent termination.\n\nThe following day, the court issued an order to show cause and set a hearing in the district court for August 12, 2025. After the hearing, the court ordered the NSF to vacate the grant suspensions and restore the affected class members to the status quo by reinstating their grants. The court found that the NSF\u2019s use of \u201csuspension\u201d was indistinguishable from a termination, which the preliminary injunction prohibited. The court clarified that \u201ctermination\u201d encompassed long-term or indefinite funding cuts, such as the NSF\u2019s suspensions. The court also held that the NSF\u2019s letters lacked grant-specific reasons for the cuts and failed to explain how researchers\u2019 reliance interests were considered. Although the letters included boilerplate language on reliance interests, they contained no individualized analysis of harm to researchers.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion to partially stay the June 23 preliminary injunction, finding that the defendants were unlikely to succeed on the merits, the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act, the plaintiffs had standing, and that the grant terminations were likely arbitrary, capricious, and viewpoint-based under the First Amendment. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 claims of irreparable harm, reasoning that stopping unlawful practices did not qualify. By contrast, the court found that a stay would cause serious harm to the plaintiffs, including layoffs, program disruptions, and the loss of research. Finally, ithe court determined that the public interest weighed against halting taxpayer-funded projects already underway.\n\nThis case is ongoing, with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s August 21 decision allowing grant funding to continue while the defendants\u2019 appeal of the injunction proceeds.",

    "target": "This case is about the alleged unlawful termination, suspension, or reduction of federal research grants to University of California researchers under a series of executive orders issued by President Trump and directives from the Department of Governmental Ethics (DOGE). On June 4, 2025, a group of University of California researchers, faculty, staff, academic appointees, and employees filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Trump, DOGE, and numerous federal agencies, departments, and their heads.

The letter stated that the NSF's July 30, 2025, letter to UCLA's Chancellor had suspended the grants because they were \"not aligned with current NSF priorities and/or programmatic goals,\" which the plaintiffs argued was \"indistinguishable\" from the form termination letters that the court had already deemed insufficient under the Administrative Procedure Act. An August 1, 2025, letter from the NSF further accused UCLA of noncompliance with federal statutes and regulations, citing its \"affirmative action\" policies, its failure to combat \"antisemitism and bias,\" and its allowance of transgender athletes in women's sports. The plaintiffs argued that these actions violated the First Amendment and constituted an attempt to \"penalize disfavored viewpoints.\" The letter also highlighted that the NSF had not sought a stay of the preliminary injunction and, in fact, that its attorney had told the Ninth Circuit that the NSF did not want to terminate grants, reinstate them, and then terminate them again\u2014an assertion the plaintiffs believed misrepresented their intent.\n\nThe defendants argued that the June 23 preliminary injunction should not be extended to cover the suspension of grants to UCLA. They contended that the factual and legal basis for the suspensions was fundamentally different from the terminations at issue in the original injunction. They stated that the suspensions were based on an investigation into UCLA's alleged discriminatory practices, not on a keyword-based termination of \"equity-related\" grants. The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the suspensions because none of the named plaintiffs had their grants suspended for the reasons cited in the NSF's letters. Furthermore, they asserted that the court lacked jurisdiction to modify the injunction, as it would \"materially alter the core questions of the case on appeal\" by requiring a new analysis of different claims and facts. The brief also highlighted that the suspensions were a temporary action, not a permanent termination, and that the NSF was willing to work with UCLA to bring them into compliance to prevent termination.\n\nThe following day, the court issued an order to show cause and set a hearing in the district court for August 12, 2025. After the hearing, the court ordered the NSF to vacate the grant suspensions and restore the affected class members to the status quo by reinstating their grants. The court found that the NSF\u2019s use of \u201csuspension\u201d was indistinguishable from a termination, which the preliminary injunction prohibited. The court clarified that \u201ctermination\u201d encompassed long-term or indefinite funding cuts, such as the NSF\u2019s suspensions. The court also held that the NSF\u2019s letters lacked grant-specific reasons for the cuts and failed to explain how researchers\u2019 reliance interests were considered. Although the letters included boilerplate language on reliance interests, they contained no individualized analysis of harm to researchers.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion to partially stay the June 23 preliminary injunction, finding that the defendants were unlikely to succeed on the merits, the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act, the plaintiffs had standing, and that the grant terminations were likely arbitrary, capricious, and viewpoint-based under the First Amendment. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 claims of irreparable harm, reasoning that stopping unlawful practices did not qualify. By contrast, the court found that a stay would cause serious harm to the plaintiffs, including layoffs, program disruptions, and the loss of research. Finally, ithe court determined that the public interest weighed against halting taxpayer-funded projects already underway.\n\nThis case is ongoing, with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s August 21 decision allowing grant funding to continue while the defendants\u2019 appeal of the injunction proceeds.",

    "target": "This case is about the alleged unlawful termination, suspension, or reduction of federal research grants to University of California researchers under a series of executive orders issued by President Trump and directives from the Department of Governmental Ethics (DOGE). On June 4, 2025, a group of University of California researchers, faculty, staff, academic appointees, and employees filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Trump, DOGE, and numerous federal agencies, departments, and their heads. Judge Rita F. Lin was assigned to the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that these grant-related actions (1) exceeded presidential and agency authority in violation of the Separation of Powers, (2) infringed on academic freedom and free expression in violation of the First Amendment, (3) deprived them of due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment, (4) violated statutory limitations on executive spending authority under the Impoundment Control Act, and (5) constituted arbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the enforcement of the challenged executive orders and directives, as well as reinstatement of their research funding and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n\nOn June 5, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order to stop the defendants from taking any further actions to unlawfully terminate federal research grants. Specifically, the plaintiffs asked the court to restore their previously awarded grants, provide no-cost extensions for the time necessary to complete their interrupted work, and require the defendants to return to their lawful grant procedures from before January 20, 2025. These procedures included providing plaintiffs with reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard before termination, as well as a specific, individualized explanation for any proposed termination. The motion also sought to compel the defendants to file declarations verifying their compliance with the court's order.\n\nAlso on June 5, 2025, the plalintiffs moved for class certification, seeking to represent a proposed class of \u201cAll University of California researchers, including faculty, staff, academic appointees, and employees across the University of California system whose research grants have been or will be terminated, denied, suspended, or reduced\u201d by the defendants pursuant to Executive Orders 14151, 14154, 14158, 14168, 14173, 14217, 14238, and/or 14222, or any other Trump Administration or DOGE directives issued on or after January 20, 2025.\n\nOn June 23, 2025, Judge Lin granted the motion for a preliminary injunction and provisional class certification, extending the injunction to all similarly situated University of California researchers. 2025 WL 1734471. The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims under the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act, noting that the defendants\u2019 actions showed signs of \"quintessential viewpoint discrimination\". The order immediately enjoined the Trump Administration, DOGE, and the involved federal agencies from giving effect to the vacated grant terminations and prohibited any future terminations that would meet the criteria of the certified classes. It also required that the defendants restore the grants to the plaintiffs, pending the resolution of the case.\n\nOn July 10, 2025, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The following day, they filed a motion in the Ninth Circuit seeking a partial stay of the district court\u2019s injunction, limited to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). They argued that the injunction was overly broad, that the First Amendment did not require the defendants to subsidize particular projects or to do so on a content-neutral basis, that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, and that the EPA\u2019s actions were unreviewable because they were committed to agency discretion by law. The defendants asserted that the injunction caused irreparable harm to the public fisc and the Executive Branch. The defendants did not seek a stay as to the National Science Foundation (NSF), which had no plans to re-terminate grants during the appeal.\n\nBack in the district court, on July 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added two University of California researchers whose work was affected by the terminated grants as plaintiffs. The amended filing also sought to add the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Transportation as defendants. The filing included concrete examples, identifying specific projects and their details to support the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of widespread and unlawful grant terminations, such as the termination of an NSF grant supplement commemorating the agency\u2019s 75th anniversary. It also added new information about the Department of Energy, noting that the agency would review 179 awards totaling more than $15 billion to ensure consistency with the Trump Administration\u2019s policies and priorities.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit heard oral argument on the preliminary injunction appeal on July 31, 2025.\n\nIn the district court, on August 1, 2025, the plaintiffs moved to extend the injunction to the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation and to certify new classes of plaintiffs, introduced in the amended complaint, whose grants had been terminated by those agencies.\n\nOn August 4, 2025, in a letter brief to the court, the plaintiffs alleged that NSF had violated the June 23 preliminary injunction by indefinitely suspending hundreds of grants to UCLA researchers is a \"de facto termination\" and a \"brazen end-around\" the court's order.

Lin was assigned to the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that these grant-related actions (1) exceeded presidential and agency authority in violation of the Separation of Powers, (2) infringed on academic freedom and free expression in violation of the First Amendment, (3) deprived them of due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment, (4) violated statutory limitations on executive spending authority under the Impoundment Control Act, and (5) constituted arbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the enforcement of the challenged executive orders and directives, as well as reinstatement of their research funding and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n\nOn June 5, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order to stop the defendants from taking any further actions to unlawfully terminate federal research grants. Specifically, the plaintiffs asked the court to restore their previously awarded grants, provide no-cost extensions for the time necessary to complete their interrupted work, and require the defendants to return to their lawful grant procedures from before January 20, 2025. These procedures included providing plaintiffs with reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard before termination, as well as a specific, individualized explanation for any proposed termination. The motion also sought to compel the defendants to file declarations verifying their compliance with the court's order.\n\nAlso on June 5, 2025, the plalintiffs moved for class certification, seeking to represent a proposed class of \u201cAll University of California researchers, including faculty, staff, academic appointees, and employees across the University of California system whose research grants have been or will be terminated, denied, suspended, or reduced\u201d by the defendants pursuant to Executive Orders 14151, 14154, 14158, 14168, 14173, 14217, 14238, and/or 14222, or any other Trump Administration or DOGE directives issued on or after January 20, 2025.\n\nOn June 23, 2025, Judge Lin granted the motion for a preliminary injunction and provisional class certification, extending the injunction to all similarly situated University of California researchers. 2025 WL 1734471. The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims under the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act, noting that the defendants\u2019 actions showed signs of \"quintessential viewpoint discrimination\". The order immediately enjoined the Trump Administration, DOGE, and the involved federal agencies from giving effect to the vacated grant terminations and prohibited any future terminations that would meet the criteria of the certified classes. It also required that the defendants restore the grants to the plaintiffs, pending the resolution of the case.\n\nOn July 10, 2025, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The following day, they filed a motion in the Ninth Circuit seeking a partial stay of the district court\u2019s injunction, limited to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). They argued that the injunction was overly broad, that the First Amendment did not require the defendants to subsidize particular projects or to do so on a content-neutral basis, that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, and that the EPA\u2019s actions were unreviewable because they were committed to agency discretion by law. The defendants asserted that the injunction caused irreparable harm to the public fisc and the Executive Branch. The defendants did not seek a stay as to the National Science Foundation (NSF), which had no plans to re-terminate grants during the appeal.\n\nBack in the district court, on July 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added two University of California researchers whose work was affected by the terminated grants as plaintiffs. The amended filing also sought to add the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Transportation as defendants. The filing included concrete examples, identifying specific projects and their details to support the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of widespread and unlawful grant terminations, such as the termination of an NSF grant supplement commemorating the agency\u2019s 75th anniversary. It also added new information about the Department of Energy, noting that the agency would review 179 awards totaling more than $15 billion to ensure consistency with the Trump Administration\u2019s policies and priorities.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit heard oral argument on the preliminary injunction appeal on July 31, 2025.\n\nIn the district court, on August 1, 2025, the plaintiffs moved to extend the injunction to the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation and to certify new classes of plaintiffs, introduced in the amended complaint, whose grants had been terminated by those agencies.\n\nOn August 4, 2025, in a letter brief to the court, the plaintiffs alleged that NSF had violated the June 23 preliminary injunction by indefinitely suspending hundreds of grants to UCLA researchers is a \"de facto termination\" and a \"brazen end-around\" the court's order. The letter stated that the NSF's July 30, 2025, letter to UCLA's Chancellor had suspended the grants because they were \"not aligned with current NSF priorities and/or programmatic goals,\" which the plaintiffs argued was \"indistinguishable\" from the form termination letters that the court had already deemed insufficient under the Administrative Procedure Act. An August 1, 2025, letter from the NSF further accused UCLA of noncompliance with federal statutes and regulations, citing its \"affirmative action\" policies, its failure to combat \"antisemitism and bias,\" and its allowance of transgender athletes in women's sports. The plaintiffs argued that these actions violated the First Amendment and constituted an attempt to \"penalize disfavored viewpoints.\" The letter also highlighted that the NSF had not sought a stay of the preliminary injunction and, in fact, that its attorney had told the Ninth Circuit that the NSF did not want to terminate grants, reinstate them, and then terminate them again\u2014an assertion the plaintiffs believed misrepresented their intent.\n\nThe defendants argued that the June 23 preliminary injunction should not be extended to cover the suspension of grants to UCLA. They contended that the factual and legal basis for the suspensions was fundamentally different from the terminations at issue in the original injunction. They stated that the suspensions were based on an investigation into UCLA's alleged discriminatory practices, not on a keyword-based termination of \"equity-related\" grants. The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the suspensions because none of the named plaintiffs had their grants suspended for the reasons cited in the NSF's letters. Furthermore, they asserted that the court lacked jurisdiction to modify the injunction, as it would \"materially alter the core questions of the case on appeal\" by requiring a new analysis of different claims and facts. The brief also highlighted that the suspensions were a temporary action, not a permanent termination, and that the NSF was willing to work with UCLA to bring them into compliance to prevent termination.\n\nThe following day, the court issued an order to show cause and set a hearing in the district court for August 12, 2025. After the hearing, the court ordered the NSF to vacate the grant suspensions and restore the affected class members to the status quo by reinstating their grants. The court found that the NSF\u2019s use of \u201csuspension\u201d was indistinguishable from a termination, which the preliminary injunction prohibited. The court clarified that \u201ctermination\u201d encompassed long-term or indefinite funding cuts, such as the NSF\u2019s suspensions. The court also held that the NSF\u2019s letters lacked grant-specific reasons for the cuts and failed to explain how researchers\u2019 reliance interests were considered. Although the letters included boilerplate language on reliance interests, they contained no individualized analysis of harm to researchers.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 motion to partially stay the June 23 preliminary injunction, finding that the defendants were unlikely to succeed on the merits, the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act, the plaintiffs had standing, and that the grant terminations were likely arbitrary, capricious, and viewpoint-based under the First Amendment. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 claims of irreparable harm, reasoning that stopping unlawful practices did not qualify. By contrast, the court found that a stay would cause serious harm to the plaintiffs, including layoffs, program disruptions, and the loss of research. Finally, ithe court determined that the public interest weighed against halting taxpayer-funded projects already underway.\n\nThis case is ongoing, with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s August 21 decision allowing grant funding to continue while the defendants\u2019 appeal of the injunction proceeds.",
