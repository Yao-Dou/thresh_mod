    "target": "This case is one of numerous lawsuits challenging the Trump administration\u2019s abrupt termination of immigration visas\u2014mostly student or work visas\u2014with no notice to the visa-holders and with dubious or no legal basis. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38954&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 11, 2025, four international students holding F-1 visas filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Acting Director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The plaintiffs claimed that the termination of their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the terminations, restore their legal status, and prevent further irreparable harm. Judge Steven White presides over the case.\n\nOn April 15, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order. They argued that the terminations were arbitrary and capricious because the government failed to provide individualized notice, consider relevant facts, or justify its decisions, and improperly relied on visa revocation, which was not a permissible basis under agency regulations and guidance. Second, they asserted a due process violation, claiming a protected interest in their F-1 status and SEVIS records that was taken away without notice, explanation, or an opportunity to respond. Third, they alleged an equal protection violation, contending that the terminations unlawfully discriminated against Chinese students, who were disproportionately targeted without evidence of security threats or regulatory violations, and were treated differently from similarly situated students of other national origins.\n\nOn April 18, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order for 14 days. 2025 WL 1150697. During that period, the defendants were barred from arresting or incarcerating the four plaintiffs, transferring them outside the Northern District of California, or imposing any legal effect from the termination of their SEVIS status or the potential unlawful revocation of their visas. The court held that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Administrative Procedure Act claim, finding that the defendants had not demonstrated compliance with regulatory requirements for SEVIS termination and that visa revocation alone did not justify such action. The court emphasized that although three plaintiffs had been arrested, none had been convicted of a crime. The court further held that the plaintiffs faced a strong likelihood of irreparable harm because their studies and work were threatened and they risked immediate arrest and deportation. The \u00a0court declined to reach the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims, finding the APA claim sufficient to warrant relief, and limited the order to the four named plaintiffs rather than granting nationwide relief.\n\nThe court later extended the temporary restraining order until May 15, 2025.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction and expanded the earlier TROs into a nationwide injunction. 2025 WL 1467543. The court held that termination of a SEVIS record effectively ended F-1 status, rejecting the defendants\u2019 argument that it served only as a \u201cred flag.\u201d The court pointed to DHS\u2019s own materials and guidance from SEVP-approved institutions showing that terminated records invalidated both student status and work authorization. The order barred the government from arresting, detaining, or transferring the plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals outside their jurisdictions of residence, from imposing legal consequences based on terminated SEVIS records, and from reversing reinstated records of those maintaining status.\n\nThe defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025.\n\nBack in the district court, on July 29, 2025, the plaintiffs added three new plaintiffs to the lawsuit and named the Director of the U.S. Department of State Visa Services Office, as a new defendant. The amended filing expanded the claims to directly challenge the Department of State\u2019s role in the SEVIS terminations by targeting the underlying visa revocations. The plaintiffs also sought new relief, asking the court to order the Secretary of State to restore their revoked F-1 visas as well as those of similarly situated individuals.\n\nOn July 30, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for an amended preliminary injunction that shifted the focus of the case to the Department of State\u2019s role in visa revocations. They argued that the Department unlawfully relied on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(i) to revoke thousands of F-1 visas, contending that the statute was intended only for visas of individuals who had not yet entered the United States. Although the court\u2019s earlier injunction restored SEVIS status, the plaintiffs emphasized that the revoked visas continued to cause harm by preventing international travel and risking re-entry denial. The motion included new declarations from three recently added plaintiffs describing these harms. The plaintiffs requested that the injunction be expanded to block any legal effect from the visa revocations and to require restoration of the revoked visas.\n\nOn August 8, 2025, the defendants moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. They argued that they were likely to succeed on appeal because the injunction was flawed, particularly in its nationwide scope, which they claimed conflicted with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc. They further contended that the plaintiffs had not shown irreparable harm since ICE had already reinstated their SEVIS records, and that the injunction was vague and overbroad by restricting arrests and transfers for any reason, including unrelated criminal violations. Finally, they asserted that a stay served the public interest by preserving law enforcement authority and protecting public safety. The defendants asked the court to stay three parts of the injunction: its nationwide scope, the prohibition on arresting or transferring the plaintiffs for reasons beyond SEVIS terminations, and the restriction on terminating SEVIS records for reasons unrelated to the Student Criminal Alien Initiative.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case is one of numerous lawsuits challenging the Trump administration\u2019s abrupt termination of immigration visas\u2014mostly student or work visas\u2014with no notice to the visa-holders and with dubious or no legal basis. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38954&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 11, 2025, four international students holding F-1 visas filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Acting Director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The plaintiffs claimed that the termination of their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the terminations, restore their legal status, and prevent further irreparable harm. Judge Steven White presides over the case.\n\nOn April 15, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order. They argued that the terminations were arbitrary and capricious because the government failed to provide individualized notice, consider relevant facts, or justify its decisions, and improperly relied on visa revocation, which was not a permissible basis under agency regulations and guidance. Second, they asserted a due process violation, claiming a protected interest in their F-1 status and SEVIS records that was taken away without notice, explanation, or an opportunity to respond. Third, they alleged an equal protection violation, contending that the terminations unlawfully discriminated against Chinese students, who were disproportionately targeted without evidence of security threats or regulatory violations, and were treated differently from similarly situated students of other national origins.\n\nOn April 18, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order for 14 days. 2025 WL 1150697. During that period, the defendants were barred from arresting or incarcerating the four plaintiffs, transferring them outside the Northern District of California, or imposing any legal effect from the termination of their SEVIS status or the potential unlawful revocation of their visas. The court held that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Administrative Procedure Act claim, finding that the defendants had not demonstrated compliance with regulatory requirements for SEVIS termination and that visa revocation alone did not justify such action. The court emphasized that although three plaintiffs had been arrested, none had been convicted of a crime. The court further held that the plaintiffs faced a strong likelihood of irreparable harm because their studies and work were threatened and they risked immediate arrest and deportation. The \u00a0court declined to reach the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims, finding the APA claim sufficient to warrant relief, and limited the order to the four named plaintiffs rather than granting nationwide relief.\n\nThe court later extended the temporary restraining order until May 15, 2025.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction and expanded the earlier TROs into a nationwide injunction. 2025 WL 1467543. The court held that termination of a SEVIS record effectively ended F-1 status, rejecting the defendants\u2019 argument that it served only as a \u201cred flag.\u201d The court pointed to DHS\u2019s own materials and guidance from SEVP-approved institutions showing that terminated records invalidated both student status and work authorization. The order barred the government from arresting, detaining, or transferring the plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals outside their jurisdictions of residence, from imposing legal consequences based on terminated SEVIS records, and from reversing reinstated records of those maintaining status.\n\nThe defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025.\n\nBack in the district court, on July 29, 2025, the plaintiffs added three new plaintiffs to the lawsuit and named the Director of the U.S. Department of State Visa Services Office, as a new defendant. The amended filing expanded the claims to directly challenge the Department of State\u2019s role in the SEVIS terminations by targeting the underlying visa revocations. The plaintiffs also sought new relief, asking the court to order the Secretary of State to restore their revoked F-1 visas as well as those of similarly situated individuals.\n\nOn July 30, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for an amended preliminary injunction that shifted the focus of the case to the Department of State\u2019s role in visa revocations. They argued that the Department unlawfully relied on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(i) to revoke thousands of F-1 visas, contending that the statute was intended only for visas of individuals who had not yet entered the United States. Although the court\u2019s earlier injunction restored SEVIS status, the plaintiffs emphasized that the revoked visas continued to cause harm by preventing international travel and risking re-entry denial. The motion included new declarations from three recently added plaintiffs describing these harms. The plaintiffs requested that the injunction be expanded to block any legal effect from the visa revocations and to require restoration of the revoked visas.\n\nOn August 8, 2025, the defendants moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. They argued that they were likely to succeed on appeal because the injunction was flawed, particularly in its nationwide scope, which they claimed conflicted with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc. They further contended that the plaintiffs had not shown irreparable harm since ICE had already reinstated their SEVIS records, and that the injunction was vague and overbroad by restricting arrests and transfers for any reason, including unrelated criminal violations. Finally, they asserted that a stay served the public interest by preserving law enforcement authority and protecting public safety. The defendants asked the court to stay three parts of the injunction: its nationwide scope, the prohibition on arresting or transferring the plaintiffs for reasons beyond SEVIS terminations, and the restriction on terminating SEVIS records for reasons unrelated to the Student Criminal Alien Initiative.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38954&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 11, 2025, four international students holding F-1 visas filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Acting Director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The plaintiffs claimed that the termination of their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the terminations, restore their legal status, and prevent further irreparable harm. Judge Steven White presides over the case.\n\nOn April 15, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order. They argued that the terminations were arbitrary and capricious because the government failed to provide individualized notice, consider relevant facts, or justify its decisions, and improperly relied on visa revocation, which was not a permissible basis under agency regulations and guidance. Second, they asserted a due process violation, claiming a protected interest in their F-1 status and SEVIS records that was taken away without notice, explanation, or an opportunity to respond. Third, they alleged an equal protection violation, contending that the terminations unlawfully discriminated against Chinese students, who were disproportionately targeted without evidence of security threats or regulatory violations, and were treated differently from similarly situated students of other national origins.\n\nOn April 18, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order for 14 days. 2025 WL 1150697. During that period, the defendants were barred from arresting or incarcerating the four plaintiffs, transferring them outside the Northern District of California, or imposing any legal effect from the termination of their SEVIS status or the potential unlawful revocation of their visas. The court held that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Administrative Procedure Act claim, finding that the defendants had not demonstrated compliance with regulatory requirements for SEVIS termination and that visa revocation alone did not justify such action. The court emphasized that although three plaintiffs had been arrested, none had been convicted of a crime. The court further held that the plaintiffs faced a strong likelihood of irreparable harm because their studies and work were threatened and they risked immediate arrest and deportation. The \u00a0court declined to reach the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims, finding the APA claim sufficient to warrant relief, and limited the order to the four named plaintiffs rather than granting nationwide relief.\n\nThe court later extended the temporary restraining order until May 15, 2025.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction and expanded the earlier TROs into a nationwide injunction. 2025 WL 1467543. The court held that termination of a SEVIS record effectively ended F-1 status, rejecting the defendants\u2019 argument that it served only as a \u201cred flag.\u201d The court pointed to DHS\u2019s own materials and guidance from SEVP-approved institutions showing that terminated records invalidated both student status and work authorization. The order barred the government from arresting, detaining, or transferring the plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals outside their jurisdictions of residence, from imposing legal consequences based on terminated SEVIS records, and from reversing reinstated records of those maintaining status.\n\nThe defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025.\n\nBack in the district court, on July 29, 2025, the plaintiffs added three new plaintiffs to the lawsuit and named the Director of the U.S. Department of State Visa Services Office, as a new defendant. The amended filing expanded the claims to directly challenge the Department of State\u2019s role in the SEVIS terminations by targeting the underlying visa revocations. The plaintiffs also sought new relief, asking the court to order the Secretary of State to restore their revoked F-1 visas as well as those of similarly situated individuals.\n\nOn July 30, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for an amended preliminary injunction that shifted the focus of the case to the Department of State\u2019s role in visa revocations. They argued that the Department unlawfully relied on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(i) to revoke thousands of F-1 visas, contending that the statute was intended only for visas of individuals who had not yet entered the United States. Although the court\u2019s earlier injunction restored SEVIS status, the plaintiffs emphasized that the revoked visas continued to cause harm by preventing international travel and risking re-entry denial. The motion included new declarations from three recently added plaintiffs describing these harms. The plaintiffs requested that the injunction be expanded to block any legal effect from the visa revocations and to require restoration of the revoked visas.\n\nOn August 8, 2025, the defendants moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. They argued that they were likely to succeed on appeal because the injunction was flawed, particularly in its nationwide scope, which they claimed conflicted with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc. They further contended that the plaintiffs had not shown irreparable harm since ICE had already reinstated their SEVIS records, and that the injunction was vague and overbroad by restricting arrests and transfers for any reason, including unrelated criminal violations. Finally, they asserted that a stay served the public interest by preserving law enforcement authority and protecting public safety. The defendants asked the court to stay three parts of the injunction: its nationwide scope, the prohibition on arresting or transferring the plaintiffs for reasons beyond SEVIS terminations, and the restriction on terminating SEVIS records for reasons unrelated to the Student Criminal Alien Initiative.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38954&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 11, 2025, four international students holding F-1 visas filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Acting Director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The plaintiffs claimed that the termination of their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

The plaintiffs claimed that the termination of their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

Second, they asserted a due process violation, claiming a protected interest in their F-1 status and SEVIS records that was taken away without notice, explanation, or an opportunity to respond. Third, they alleged an equal protection violation, contending that the terminations unlawfully discriminated against Chinese students, who were disproportionately targeted without evidence of security threats or regulatory violations, and were treated differently from similarly situated students of other national origins.\n\nOn April 18, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order for 14 days. 2025 WL 1150697.

The court held that termination of a SEVIS record effectively ended F-1 status, rejecting the defendants\u2019 argument that it served only as a \u201cred flag.\u201d The court pointed to DHS\u2019s own materials and guidance from SEVP-approved institutions showing that terminated records invalidated both student status and work authorization. The order barred the government from arresting, detaining, or transferring the plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals outside their jurisdictions of residence, from imposing legal consequences based on terminated SEVIS records, and from reversing reinstated records of those maintaining status.\n\nThe defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025.\n\nBack in the district court, on July 29, 2025, the plaintiffs added three new plaintiffs to the lawsuit and named the Director of the U.S. Department of State Visa Services Office, as a new defendant. The amended filing expanded the claims to directly challenge the Department of State\u2019s role in the SEVIS terminations by targeting the underlying visa revocations. The plaintiffs also sought new relief, asking the court to order the Secretary of State to restore their revoked F-1 visas as well as those of similarly situated individuals.\n\nOn July 30, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for an amended preliminary injunction that shifted the focus of the case to the Department of State\u2019s role in visa revocations. They argued that the Department unlawfully relied on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(i) to revoke thousands of F-1 visas, contending that the statute was intended only for visas of individuals who had not yet entered the United States. Although the court\u2019s earlier injunction restored SEVIS status, the plaintiffs emphasized that the revoked visas continued to cause harm by preventing international travel and risking re-entry denial. The motion included new declarations from three recently added plaintiffs describing these harms. The plaintiffs requested that the injunction be expanded to block any legal effect from the visa revocations and to require restoration of the revoked visas.\n\nOn August 8, 2025, the defendants moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. They argued that they were likely to succeed on appeal because the injunction was flawed, particularly in its nationwide scope, which they claimed conflicted with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc. They further contended that the plaintiffs had not shown irreparable harm since ICE had already reinstated their SEVIS records, and that the injunction was vague and overbroad by restricting arrests and transfers for any reason, including unrelated criminal violations. Finally, they asserted that a stay served the public interest by preserving law enforcement authority and protecting public safety. The defendants asked the court to stay three parts of the injunction: its nationwide scope, the prohibition on arresting or transferring the plaintiffs for reasons beyond SEVIS terminations, and the restriction on terminating SEVIS records for reasons unrelated to the Student Criminal Alien Initiative.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case is one of numerous lawsuits challenging the Trump administration\u2019s abrupt termination of immigration visas\u2014mostly student or work visas\u2014with no notice to the visa-holders and with dubious or no legal basis. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38954&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 11, 2025, four international students holding F-1 visas filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Acting Director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The plaintiffs claimed that the termination of their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the terminations, restore their legal status, and prevent further irreparable harm. Judge Steven White presides over the case.\n\nOn April 15, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order. They argued that the terminations were arbitrary and capricious because the government failed to provide individualized notice, consider relevant facts, or justify its decisions, and improperly relied on visa revocation, which was not a permissible basis under agency regulations and guidance. Second, they asserted a due process violation, claiming a protected interest in their F-1 status and SEVIS records that was taken away without notice, explanation, or an opportunity to respond. Third, they alleged an equal protection violation, contending that the terminations unlawfully discriminated against Chinese students, who were disproportionately targeted without evidence of security threats or regulatory violations, and were treated differently from similarly situated students of other national origins.\n\nOn April 18, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order for 14 days. 2025 WL 1150697. During that period, the defendants were barred from arresting or incarcerating the four plaintiffs, transferring them outside the Northern District of California, or imposing any legal effect from the termination of their SEVIS status or the potential unlawful revocation of their visas. The court held that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Administrative Procedure Act claim, finding that the defendants had not demonstrated compliance with regulatory requirements for SEVIS termination and that visa revocation alone did not justify such action. The court emphasized that although three plaintiffs had been arrested, none had been convicted of a crime. The court further held that the plaintiffs faced a strong likelihood of irreparable harm because their studies and work were threatened and they risked immediate arrest and deportation.

You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38954&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 11, 2025, four international students holding F-1 visas filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Acting Director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The plaintiffs claimed that the termination of their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the terminations, restore their legal status, and prevent further irreparable harm. Judge Steven White presides over the case.\n\nOn April 15, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order. They argued that the terminations were arbitrary and capricious because the government failed to provide individualized notice, consider relevant facts, or justify its decisions, and improperly relied on visa revocation, which was not a permissible basis under agency regulations and guidance. Second, they asserted a due process violation, claiming a protected interest in their F-1 status and SEVIS records that was taken away without notice, explanation, or an opportunity to respond. Third, they alleged an equal protection violation, contending that the terminations unlawfully discriminated against Chinese students, who were disproportionately targeted without evidence of security threats or regulatory violations, and were treated differently from similarly situated students of other national origins.\n\nOn April 18, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order for 14 days. 2025 WL 1150697. During that period, the defendants were barred from arresting or incarcerating the four plaintiffs, transferring them outside the Northern District of California, or imposing any legal effect from the termination of their SEVIS status or the potential unlawful revocation of their visas. The court held that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Administrative Procedure Act claim, finding that the defendants had not demonstrated compliance with regulatory requirements for SEVIS termination and that visa revocation alone did not justify such action. The court emphasized that although three plaintiffs had been arrested, none had been convicted of a crime. The court further held that the plaintiffs faced a strong likelihood of irreparable harm because their studies and work were threatened and they risked immediate arrest and deportation. The \u00a0court declined to reach the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims, finding the APA claim sufficient to warrant relief, and limited the order to the four named plaintiffs rather than granting nationwide relief.\n\nThe court later extended the temporary restraining order until May 15, 2025.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction and expanded the earlier TROs into a nationwide injunction. 2025 WL 1467543. The court held that termination of a SEVIS record effectively ended F-1 status, rejecting the defendants\u2019 argument that it served only as a \u201cred flag.\u201d The court pointed to DHS\u2019s own materials and guidance from SEVP-approved institutions showing that terminated records invalidated both student status and work authorization. The order barred the government from arresting, detaining, or transferring the plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals outside their jurisdictions of residence, from imposing legal consequences based on terminated SEVIS records, and from reversing reinstated records of those maintaining status.\n\nThe defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025.\n\nBack in the district court, on July 29, 2025, the plaintiffs added three new plaintiffs to the lawsuit and named the Director of the U.S. Department of State Visa Services Office, as a new defendant. The amended filing expanded the claims to directly challenge the Department of State\u2019s role in the SEVIS terminations by targeting the underlying visa revocations. The plaintiffs also sought new relief, asking the court to order the Secretary of State to restore their revoked F-1 visas as well as those of similarly situated individuals.\n\nOn July 30, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for an amended preliminary injunction that shifted the focus of the case to the Department of State\u2019s role in visa revocations. They argued that the Department unlawfully relied on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(i) to revoke thousands of F-1 visas, contending that the statute was intended only for visas of individuals who had not yet entered the United States. Although the court\u2019s earlier injunction restored SEVIS status, the plaintiffs emphasized that the revoked visas continued to cause harm by preventing international travel and risking re-entry denial. The motion included new declarations from three recently added plaintiffs describing these harms. The plaintiffs requested that the injunction be expanded to block any legal effect from the visa revocations and to require restoration of the revoked visas.\n\nOn August 8, 2025, the defendants moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. They argued that they were likely to succeed on appeal because the injunction was flawed, particularly in its nationwide scope, which they claimed conflicted with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Trump v.

The plaintiffs also sought new relief, asking the court to order the Secretary of State to restore their revoked F-1 visas as well as those of similarly situated individuals.\n\nOn July 30, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for an amended preliminary injunction that shifted the focus of the case to the Department of State\u2019s role in visa revocations. They argued that the Department unlawfully relied on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(i) to revoke thousands of F-1 visas, contending that the statute was intended only for visas of individuals who had not yet entered the United States. Although the court\u2019s earlier injunction restored SEVIS status, the plaintiffs emphasized that the revoked visas continued to cause harm by preventing international travel and risking re-entry denial. The motion included new declarations from three recently added plaintiffs describing these harms. The plaintiffs requested that the injunction be expanded to block any legal effect from the visa revocations and to require restoration of the revoked visas.\n\nOn August 8, 2025, the defendants moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. They argued that they were likely to succeed on appeal because the injunction was flawed, particularly in its nationwide scope, which they claimed conflicted with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc. They further contended that the plaintiffs had not shown irreparable harm since ICE had already reinstated their SEVIS records, and that the injunction was vague and overbroad by restricting arrests and transfers for any reason, including unrelated criminal violations. Finally, they asserted that a stay served the public interest by preserving law enforcement authority and protecting public safety. The defendants asked the court to stay three parts of the injunction: its nationwide scope, the prohibition on arresting or transferring the plaintiffs for reasons beyond SEVIS terminations, and the restriction on terminating SEVIS records for reasons unrelated to the Student Criminal Alien Initiative.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case is one of numerous lawsuits challenging the Trump administration\u2019s abrupt termination of immigration visas\u2014mostly student or work visas\u2014with no notice to the visa-holders and with dubious or no legal basis. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38954&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 11, 2025, four international students holding F-1 visas filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Acting Director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The plaintiffs claimed that the termination of their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the terminations, restore their legal status, and prevent further irreparable harm. Judge Steven White presides over the case.\n\nOn April 15, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order. They argued that the terminations were arbitrary and capricious because the government failed to provide individualized notice, consider relevant facts, or justify its decisions, and improperly relied on visa revocation, which was not a permissible basis under agency regulations and guidance. Second, they asserted a due process violation, claiming a protected interest in their F-1 status and SEVIS records that was taken away without notice, explanation, or an opportunity to respond. Third, they alleged an equal protection violation, contending that the terminations unlawfully discriminated against Chinese students, who were disproportionately targeted without evidence of security threats or regulatory violations, and were treated differently from similarly situated students of other national origins.\n\nOn April 18, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order for 14 days. 2025 WL 1150697. During that period, the defendants were barred from arresting or incarcerating the four plaintiffs, transferring them outside the Northern District of California, or imposing any legal effect from the termination of their SEVIS status or the potential unlawful revocation of their visas. The court held that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Administrative Procedure Act claim, finding that the defendants had not demonstrated compliance with regulatory requirements for SEVIS termination and that visa revocation alone did not justify such action. The court emphasized that although three plaintiffs had been arrested, none had been convicted of a crime. The court further held that the plaintiffs faced a strong likelihood of irreparable harm because their studies and work were threatened and they risked immediate arrest and deportation. The \u00a0court declined to reach the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims, finding the APA claim sufficient to warrant relief, and limited the order to the four named plaintiffs rather than granting nationwide relief.\n\nThe court later extended the temporary restraining order until May 15, 2025.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction and expanded the earlier TROs into a nationwide injunction. 2025 WL 1467543. The court held that termination of a SEVIS record effectively ended F-1 status, rejecting the defendants\u2019 argument that it served only as a \u201cred flag.\u201d The court pointed to DHS\u2019s own materials and guidance from SEVP-approved institutions showing that terminated records invalidated both student status and work authorization. The order barred the government from arresting, detaining, or transferring the plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals outside their jurisdictions of residence, from imposing legal consequences based on terminated SEVIS records, and from reversing reinstated records of those maintaining status.\n\nThe defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025.\n\nBack in the district court, on July 29, 2025, the plaintiffs added three new plaintiffs to the lawsuit and named the Director of the U.S. Department of State Visa Services Office, as a new defendant.
