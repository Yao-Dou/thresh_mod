Plaintiff alleged that from at least 2015 through at least 2023, multiple Southwest Key employees subjected unaccompanied children in their care to repeated sexual abuse, harassment, and misconduct and a hostile housing environment, including severe sexual abuse and rape, solicitation of sex acts, solicitation of nude photos, sexual comments and gestures, and inappropriate touching.

Plaintiff alleged that from at least 2015 through at least 2023, multiple Southwest Key employees subjected unaccompanied children in their care to repeated sexual abuse, harassment, and misconduct and a hostile housing environment, including severe sexual abuse and rape, solicitation of sex acts, solicitation of nude photos, sexual comments and gestures, and inappropriate touching. Plaintiff alleged that these actions constituted a pattern or practice of discrimination in housing because of sex in violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(a); discriminated in the terms, conditions, or privileges of the rental or sale of dwellings, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of sex, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(b); made statements with respect to the sale or rental of dwellings that indicate a preference, a limitation, or discrimination based on sex, in violation 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(c); and coerced, intimidated, threatened, or interfered with persons in the exercise or enjoyment of, or on account of their having exercised or enjoyed, their rights granted or protected by the Fair Housing Act, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3617. 74. 75. \u00a7 3602(b).\n\nPlaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief enjoining Defendant from continuing to engage in any discriminatory housing practice and engaging in sexual harassment; interfering with or threatening to take any action against any person engaged in the exercise or enjoyment of rights granted or protected by the Fair Housing Act; failing or refusing to take such affirmative steps to restore the victims; and failing or refusing to take affirmative steps to prevent the recurrence of any discriminatory conduct. Plaintiff also sought monetary damages to each person aggrieved by Southwest Key\u2019s discriminatory conduct.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Alan D Albright.\n\nOn September 13, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss. Defendant argued that the Fair Housing Act does not apply to shelters; shelter care facilities are not \u201chomes\u201d under the definition of the Fair Housing Act; and the alleged conduct did not involve the initial provision of housing, or a \u201csale\u201d or \u201crental.\u201d\n\nBefore the court could rule on the motion to dismiss, on March 12, 2025, Plaintiff - now controlled by the Trump Administration - moved to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice. This action followed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) decision to stop placing unaccompanied children in Southwest Key shelters and to review the organization's federal grants. HHS stated that all children had been moved to other shelters due to ongoing concerns. According to Attorney General Pam Bondi, \u201cSecuring our border and protecting children from abuse are among the most critical missions of the Department of Justice and the Trump administration\u2026under the border policies of the previous administration, bad actors were incentivized to exploit children and break our laws: this ends now\u201d (HHS, DOJ Move to End Sexual Abuse and Harassment of Unaccompanied Alien Children in Shelters Operated by Southwest Key Programs [https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/hhs-doj-move-end-sexual-abuse-and-harassment-unaccompanied-alien-children-shelters-operated?utm_source=chatgpt.com]).\n\nThe case was closed on March 12, 2025.",

Plaintiff alleged that from at least 2015 through at least 2023, multiple Southwest Key employees subjected unaccompanied children in their care to repeated sexual abuse, harassment, and misconduct and a hostile housing environment, including severe sexual abuse and rape, solicitation of sex acts, solicitation of nude photos, sexual comments and gestures, and inappropriate touching. Plaintiff alleged that these actions constituted a pattern or practice of discrimination in housing because of sex in violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(a); discriminated in the terms, conditions, or privileges of the rental or sale of dwellings, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of sex, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(b); made statements with respect to the sale or rental of dwellings that indicate a preference, a limitation, or discrimination based on sex, in violation 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(c); and coerced, intimidated, threatened, or interfered with persons in the exercise or enjoyment of, or on account of their having exercised or enjoyed, their rights granted or protected by the Fair Housing Act, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3617. 74. 75. \u00a7 3602(b).\n\nPlaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief enjoining Defendant from continuing to engage in any discriminatory housing practice and engaging in sexual harassment; interfering with or threatening to take any action against any person engaged in the exercise or enjoyment of rights granted or protected by the Fair Housing Act; failing or refusing to take such affirmative steps to restore the victims; and failing or refusing to take affirmative steps to prevent the recurrence of any discriminatory conduct. Plaintiff also sought monetary damages to each person aggrieved by Southwest Key\u2019s discriminatory conduct.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Alan D Albright.\n\nOn September 13, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss. Defendant argued that the Fair Housing Act does not apply to shelters; shelter care facilities are not \u201chomes\u201d under the definition of the Fair Housing Act; and the alleged conduct did not involve the initial provision of housing, or a \u201csale\u201d or \u201crental.\u201d\n\nBefore the court could rule on the motion to dismiss, on March 12, 2025, Plaintiff - now controlled by the Trump Administration - moved to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice.
