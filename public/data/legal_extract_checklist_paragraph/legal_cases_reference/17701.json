    "target": "This is a case about Houston police arresting individuals without warrants and detaining them without probable cause. On December 5, 2016, two plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated sued the City of Houston under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Represented by private counsel and the Civil Rights Corps, the plaintiffs sought compensatory damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. They claimed that the City of Houston regularly arrested individuals without warrants and detained them without probable cause hearings for longer than permitted by the United States Constitution.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Kennth M. Hoyt on December 7, 2016. The City filed a motion to dismiss the initial complaint. One of the named plaintiffs withdrew from the case and on March 1, 2017, the plaintiffs amended the complaint to add three more named plaintiffs. As a result, on March 7, the court denied the City's motion to dismiss on grounds of mootness because the filing of an amended complaint renders a prior complaint void and moots any motion to dismiss.\n\nThe City filed an amended motion to dismiss, which was denied on June 6, 2017. The court found that the defendants had essentially admitted that the facts the plaintiffs pleaded were true.\n\nThe case proceeded to discovery, and the parties engaged in lengthy discovery disputes. On August 30, 2018, the District Court issued an order stating that the City of Houston had intentionally destroyed evidence pertinent to the lawsuit. As a result, the Court held that inferences were appropriate: (1) throughout the class period, the City of Houston had a policy of not releasing warrantless arrestees who had not received neutral determinations of probable cause within the constitutionally required period of time; (2) throughout the class period, the City\u2019s policymakers were aware of this policy; and (3) the City acted with deliberate indifference with respect to its unconstitutional policy of not releasing warrantless arrestees who hadn\u2019t received probable cause hearings in the appropriate amount of time.\n\nOn December 11, 2018, the plaintiffs moved to certify their class. The first amended complaint detailed a single class of plaintiffs seeking compensatory relief, which applied to all those arrested without warrant and held for more than 48 hours without a prompt judicial determination of probable cause.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on December 13, 2018, which added a fifth named plaintiff. Additionally, this second amended complaint defined two classes seeking compensatory relief. The first subclass included all those arrested and held held by the City of Houston without a warrant or a judicial determination of probably cause for 48 hours or more, and the second subclass included those who were arrested and held between 24 and 48 hours.\n\nIn spring 2019, the District Court issued an order overruling a motion from the City that asked the Court to exclude certain documents that they claimed to be privileged from evidence. The plaintiffs filed a motion to compel the city to produce these documents, which was stayed by Judge Hoyt pending the City\u2019s appeal. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals then vacated the District Court\u2019s order with respect to one document, and denied the City\u2019s claim of privilege in all other respects. Upon remand, the District Court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel.\n\nIn late June 2019, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. On July 3, 2019, Judge Hoyt granted the plaintiffs\u2019 earlier motion for class certification. One week later, the City filed a motion to stay the case pending interlocutory appeal regarding the class certification issue, which was denied by the district court in early August. And, shortly after on August 8, 2020 the Fifth Circuit denied the defendants leave to appeal the grant of class certification.\n\nAt some during the summer of 2019, the parties began going through mediation and started settlement negotiations, and on August 13, 2019, a joint order to stay the case pending the finalization of settlement was granted.\n\nIn July 2020, Houston City Council voted to pass a settlement awarding the plaintiffs $1.17 million in exchange for indemnity. The court granted a joint motion for preliminary approval of the settlement on October 22, 2020.\n\nOn March 18, 2021, the court approved the settlement agreement determining it was fair, reasonable, and adequate for the class. The settlement payment was $1.17 million.\n\nOn August 9, 2022, the plaintiffs' attorney filed an unopposed motion for attorneys' fees and costs. On September 7, 2022, the court granted the motion for fees and costs. Attorneys' fees were $93, 241.28 (part of the total $1.17 million settlement). On December 20, 2024, the case was formally closed.",

    "target": "This is a case about Houston police arresting individuals without warrants and detaining them without probable cause. On December 5, 2016, two plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated sued the City of Houston under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Represented by private counsel and the Civil Rights Corps, the plaintiffs sought compensatory damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. They claimed that the City of Houston regularly arrested individuals without warrants and detained them without probable cause hearings for longer than permitted by the United States Constitution.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Kennth M. Hoyt on December 7, 2016. The City filed a motion to dismiss the initial complaint. One of the named plaintiffs withdrew from the case and on March 1, 2017, the plaintiffs amended the complaint to add three more named plaintiffs. As a result, on March 7, the court denied the City's motion to dismiss on grounds of mootness because the filing of an amended complaint renders a prior complaint void and moots any motion to dismiss.\n\nThe City filed an amended motion to dismiss, which was denied on June 6, 2017. The court found that the defendants had essentially admitted that the facts the plaintiffs pleaded were true.\n\nThe case proceeded to discovery, and the parties engaged in lengthy discovery disputes. On August 30, 2018, the District Court issued an order stating that the City of Houston had intentionally destroyed evidence pertinent to the lawsuit. As a result, the Court held that inferences were appropriate: (1) throughout the class period, the City of Houston had a policy of not releasing warrantless arrestees who had not received neutral determinations of probable cause within the constitutionally required period of time; (2) throughout the class period, the City\u2019s policymakers were aware of this policy; and (3) the City acted with deliberate indifference with respect to its unconstitutional policy of not releasing warrantless arrestees who hadn\u2019t received probable cause hearings in the appropriate amount of time.\n\nOn December 11, 2018, the plaintiffs moved to certify their class. The first amended complaint detailed a single class of plaintiffs seeking compensatory relief, which applied to all those arrested without warrant and held for more than 48 hours without a prompt judicial determination of probable cause.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on December 13, 2018, which added a fifth named plaintiff. Additionally, this second amended complaint defined two classes seeking compensatory relief. The first subclass included all those arrested and held held by the City of Houston without a warrant or a judicial determination of probably cause for 48 hours or more, and the second subclass included those who were arrested and held between 24 and 48 hours.\n\nIn spring 2019, the District Court issued an order overruling a motion from the City that asked the Court to exclude certain documents that they claimed to be privileged from evidence. The plaintiffs filed a motion to compel the city to produce these documents, which was stayed by Judge Hoyt pending the City\u2019s appeal. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals then vacated the District Court\u2019s order with respect to one document, and denied the City\u2019s claim of privilege in all other respects. Upon remand, the District Court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel.\n\nIn late June 2019, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. On July 3, 2019, Judge Hoyt granted the plaintiffs\u2019 earlier motion for class certification. One week later, the City filed a motion to stay the case pending interlocutory appeal regarding the class certification issue, which was denied by the district court in early August. And, shortly after on August 8, 2020 the Fifth Circuit denied the defendants leave to appeal the grant of class certification.\n\nAt some during the summer of 2019, the parties began going through mediation and started settlement negotiations, and on August 13, 2019, a joint order to stay the case pending the finalization of settlement was granted.\n\nIn July 2020, Houston City Council voted to pass a settlement awarding the plaintiffs $1.17 million in exchange for indemnity. The court granted a joint motion for preliminary approval of the settlement on October 22, 2020.\n\nOn March 18, 2021, the court approved the settlement agreement determining it was fair, reasonable, and adequate for the class. The settlement payment was $1.17 million.\n\nOn August 9, 2022, the plaintiffs' attorney filed an unopposed motion for attorneys' fees and costs. On September 7, 2022, the court granted the motion for fees and costs. Attorneys' fees were $93, 241.28 (part of the total $1.17 million settlement). On December 20, 2024, the case was formally closed.",

    "target": "This is a case about Houston police arresting individuals without warrants and detaining them without probable cause. On December 5, 2016, two plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated sued the City of Houston under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Represented by private counsel and the Civil Rights Corps, the plaintiffs sought compensatory damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. They claimed that the City of Houston regularly arrested individuals without warrants and detained them without probable cause hearings for longer than permitted by the United States Constitution.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Kennth M. Hoyt on December 7, 2016. The City filed a motion to dismiss the initial complaint. One of the named plaintiffs withdrew from the case and on March 1, 2017, the plaintiffs amended the complaint to add three more named plaintiffs. As a result, on March 7, the court denied the City's motion to dismiss on grounds of mootness because the filing of an amended complaint renders a prior complaint void and moots any motion to dismiss.\n\nThe City filed an amended motion to dismiss, which was denied on June 6, 2017. The court found that the defendants had essentially admitted that the facts the plaintiffs pleaded were true.\n\nThe case proceeded to discovery, and the parties engaged in lengthy discovery disputes. On August 30, 2018, the District Court issued an order stating that the City of Houston had intentionally destroyed evidence pertinent to the lawsuit. As a result, the Court held that inferences were appropriate: (1) throughout the class period, the City of Houston had a policy of not releasing warrantless arrestees who had not received neutral determinations of probable cause within the constitutionally required period of time; (2) throughout the class period, the City\u2019s policymakers were aware of this policy; and (3) the City acted with deliberate indifference with respect to its unconstitutional policy of not releasing warrantless arrestees who hadn\u2019t received probable cause hearings in the appropriate amount of time.\n\nOn December 11, 2018, the plaintiffs moved to certify their class. The first amended complaint detailed a single class of plaintiffs seeking compensatory relief, which applied to all those arrested without warrant and held for more than 48 hours without a prompt judicial determination of probable cause.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on December 13, 2018, which added a fifth named plaintiff. Additionally, this second amended complaint defined two classes seeking compensatory relief. The first subclass included all those arrested and held held by the City of Houston without a warrant or a judicial determination of probably cause for 48 hours or more, and the second subclass included those who were arrested and held between 24 and 48 hours.\n\nIn spring 2019, the District Court issued an order overruling a motion from the City that asked the Court to exclude certain documents that they claimed to be privileged from evidence. The plaintiffs filed a motion to compel the city to produce these documents, which was stayed by Judge Hoyt pending the City\u2019s appeal. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals then vacated the District Court\u2019s order with respect to one document, and denied the City\u2019s claim of privilege in all other respects. Upon remand, the District Court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel.\n\nIn late June 2019, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. On July 3, 2019, Judge Hoyt granted the plaintiffs\u2019 earlier motion for class certification. One week later, the City filed a motion to stay the case pending interlocutory appeal regarding the class certification issue, which was denied by the district court in early August. And, shortly after on August 8, 2020 the Fifth Circuit denied the defendants leave to appeal the grant of class certification.\n\nAt some during the summer of 2019, the parties began going through mediation and started settlement negotiations, and on August 13, 2019, a joint order to stay the case pending the finalization of settlement was granted.\n\nIn July 2020, Houston City Council voted to pass a settlement awarding the plaintiffs $1.17 million in exchange for indemnity. The court granted a joint motion for preliminary approval of the settlement on October 22, 2020.\n\nOn March 18, 2021, the court approved the settlement agreement determining it was fair, reasonable, and adequate for the class. The settlement payment was $1.17 million.\n\nOn August 9, 2022, the plaintiffs' attorney filed an unopposed motion for attorneys' fees and costs. On September 7, 2022, the court granted the motion for fees and costs. Attorneys' fees were $93, 241.28 (part of the total $1.17 million settlement).

    "target": "This is a case about Houston police arresting individuals without warrants and detaining them without probable cause. On December 5, 2016, two plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated sued the City of Houston under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Represented by private counsel and the Civil Rights Corps, the plaintiffs sought compensatory damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. They claimed that the City of Houston regularly arrested individuals without warrants and detained them without probable cause hearings for longer than permitted by the United States Constitution.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Kennth M. Hoyt on December 7, 2016. The City filed a motion to dismiss the initial complaint. One of the named plaintiffs withdrew from the case and on March 1, 2017, the plaintiffs amended the complaint to add three more named plaintiffs. As a result, on March 7, the court denied the City's motion to dismiss on grounds of mootness because the filing of an amended complaint renders a prior complaint void and moots any motion to dismiss.\n\nThe City filed an amended motion to dismiss, which was denied on June 6, 2017. The court found that the defendants had essentially admitted that the facts the plaintiffs pleaded were true.\n\nThe case proceeded to discovery, and the parties engaged in lengthy discovery disputes. On August 30, 2018, the District Court issued an order stating that the City of Houston had intentionally destroyed evidence pertinent to the lawsuit. As a result, the Court held that inferences were appropriate: (1) throughout the class period, the City of Houston had a policy of not releasing warrantless arrestees who had not received neutral determinations of probable cause within the constitutionally required period of time; (2) throughout the class period, the City\u2019s policymakers were aware of this policy; and (3) the City acted with deliberate indifference with respect to its unconstitutional policy of not releasing warrantless arrestees who hadn\u2019t received probable cause hearings in the appropriate amount of time.\n\nOn December 11, 2018, the plaintiffs moved to certify their class. The first amended complaint detailed a single class of plaintiffs seeking compensatory relief, which applied to all those arrested without warrant and held for more than 48 hours without a prompt judicial determination of probable cause.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on December 13, 2018, which added a fifth named plaintiff. Additionally, this second amended complaint defined two classes seeking compensatory relief. The first subclass included all those arrested and held held by the City of Houston without a warrant or a judicial determination of probably cause for 48 hours or more, and the second subclass included those who were arrested and held between 24 and 48 hours.\n\nIn spring 2019, the District Court issued an order overruling a motion from the City that asked the Court to exclude certain documents that they claimed to be privileged from evidence. The plaintiffs filed a motion to compel the city to produce these documents, which was stayed by Judge Hoyt pending the City\u2019s appeal. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals then vacated the District Court\u2019s order with respect to one document, and denied the City\u2019s claim of privilege in all other respects. Upon remand, the District Court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel.\n\nIn late June 2019, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. On July 3, 2019, Judge Hoyt granted the plaintiffs\u2019 earlier motion for class certification. One week later, the City filed a motion to stay the case pending interlocutory appeal regarding the class certification issue, which was denied by the district court in early August. And, shortly after on August 8, 2020 the Fifth Circuit denied the defendants leave to appeal the grant of class certification.\n\nAt some during the summer of 2019, the parties began going through mediation and started settlement negotiations, and on August 13, 2019, a joint order to stay the case pending the finalization of settlement was granted.\n\nIn July 2020, Houston City Council voted to pass a settlement awarding the plaintiffs $1.17 million in exchange for indemnity. The court granted a joint motion for preliminary approval of the settlement on October 22, 2020.\n\nOn March 18, 2021, the court approved the settlement agreement determining it was fair, reasonable, and adequate for the class. The settlement payment was $1.17 million.\n\nOn August 9, 2022, the plaintiffs' attorney filed an unopposed motion for attorneys' fees and costs. On September 7, 2022, the court granted the motion for fees and costs. Attorneys' fees were $93, 241.28 (part of the total $1.17 million settlement). On December 20, 2024, the case was formally closed.",

    "target": "This is a case about Houston police arresting individuals without warrants and detaining them without probable cause. On December 5, 2016, two plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated sued the City of Houston under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Represented by private counsel and the Civil Rights Corps, the plaintiffs sought compensatory damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. They claimed that the City of Houston regularly arrested individuals without warrants and detained them without probable cause hearings for longer than permitted by the United States Constitution.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Kennth M. Hoyt on December 7, 2016. The City filed a motion to dismiss the initial complaint. One of the named plaintiffs withdrew from the case and on March 1, 2017, the plaintiffs amended the complaint to add three more named plaintiffs. As a result, on March 7, the court denied the City's motion to dismiss on grounds of mootness because the filing of an amended complaint renders a prior complaint void and moots any motion to dismiss.\n\nThe City filed an amended motion to dismiss, which was denied on June 6, 2017. The court found that the defendants had essentially admitted that the facts the plaintiffs pleaded were true.\n\nThe case proceeded to discovery, and the parties engaged in lengthy discovery disputes. On August 30, 2018, the District Court issued an order stating that the City of Houston had intentionally destroyed evidence pertinent to the lawsuit. As a result, the Court held that inferences were appropriate: (1) throughout the class period, the City of Houston had a policy of not releasing warrantless arrestees who had not received neutral determinations of probable cause within the constitutionally required period of time; (2) throughout the class period, the City\u2019s policymakers were aware of this policy; and (3) the City acted with deliberate indifference with respect to its unconstitutional policy of not releasing warrantless arrestees who hadn\u2019t received probable cause hearings in the appropriate amount of time.\n\nOn December 11, 2018, the plaintiffs moved to certify their class. The first amended complaint detailed a single class of plaintiffs seeking compensatory relief, which applied to all those arrested without warrant and held for more than 48 hours without a prompt judicial determination of probable cause.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on December 13, 2018, which added a fifth named plaintiff. Additionally, this second amended complaint defined two classes seeking compensatory relief. The first subclass included all those arrested and held held by the City of Houston without a warrant or a judicial determination of probably cause for 48 hours or more, and the second subclass included those who were arrested and held between 24 and 48 hours.\n\nIn spring 2019, the District Court issued an order overruling a motion from the City that asked the Court to exclude certain documents that they claimed to be privileged from evidence. The plaintiffs filed a motion to compel the city to produce these documents, which was stayed by Judge Hoyt pending the City\u2019s appeal. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals then vacated the District Court\u2019s order with respect to one document, and denied the City\u2019s claim of privilege in all other respects. Upon remand, the District Court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel.\n\nIn late June 2019, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. On July 3, 2019, Judge Hoyt granted the plaintiffs\u2019 earlier motion for class certification. One week later, the City filed a motion to stay the case pending interlocutory appeal regarding the class certification issue, which was denied by the district court in early August. And, shortly after on August 8, 2020 the Fifth Circuit denied the defendants leave to appeal the grant of class certification.\n\nAt some during the summer of 2019, the parties began going through mediation and started settlement negotiations, and on August 13, 2019, a joint order to stay the case pending the finalization of settlement was granted.\n\nIn July 2020, Houston City Council voted to pass a settlement awarding the plaintiffs $1.17 million in exchange for indemnity. The court granted a joint motion for preliminary approval of the settlement on October 22, 2020.\n\nOn March 18, 2021, the court approved the settlement agreement determining it was fair, reasonable, and adequate for the class. The settlement payment was $1.17 million.\n\nOn August 9, 2022, the plaintiffs' attorney filed an unopposed motion for attorneys' fees and costs. On September 7, 2022, the court granted the motion for fees and costs. Attorneys' fees were $93, 241.28 (part of the total $1.17 million settlement). On December 20, 2024, the case was formally closed.",
