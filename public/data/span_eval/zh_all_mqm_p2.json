Historically, it was the dominant party in Israeli politics, controlling the government for much of the country's early history. However, in recent decades, it has declined in popularity and influence, largely due to the rise of right-wing parties and the changing demographics of Israeli society. The party advocates for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, social justice, and economic equality. It is currently led by Merav Michaeli. Despite its decline, it remains a significant force in Israeli politics and is often part of coalition governments. The party's base of support traditionally comes from secular Jews, labor unions, and kibbutzim.\n\n\n\n希伯来语：מִפְלָגַת הָעֲבוֹדָה‎, translit.
