Tex. 2022).\n\nThis case challenges the EEOC\u2019s April 2024 guidance under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act about workplace harassment of transgender employees. Represented by the Heritage Foundation, Texas contested the EEOC\u2019s interpretation of Title VII; in particular, Texas alleged, the parts of the Guidance about pronouns, bathrooms, and dress codes conflicted with the U.S. Supreme Court's carefully limited holding in Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), and with Title VII, which (Texas argued) does not require employers to accommodate sex, but merely requires non-discrimination.\n\nTexas filed the case on August 15, 2024, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, seeking an injunction to stop implementation and enforcement of the 2024 Guidance, because it was not (as it should have been) published in the Federal Register, was contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and exceeded EEOC's statutory rulemaking authority under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nIn October and November 2024, both parties moved for summary judgment. In January 2025, the newly inaugurated President Trump issued several Executive Orders stating there is no federal obligation to avoid discrimination against transgender people. On January 27, 2025, Judge Kacsmaryk ordered the parties to submit a joint brief detailing how new Executive Orders bear on the disposition of the litigation. Pursuant to the court's order, parties submitted the joint brief on February 10, 2025. In this brief, the parties agreed that plaintiffs retained standing and that, even in light of prior Executive Orders, the case was not moot.\n\nOn May 25 2025, Judge Kacsmaryk granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, holding that denial of accommodations for gender non-conforming employees did not constitute actionable discrimination by an employer under Loper Bright. Judge Kacsmaryk further stated that Congress reserved the exclusive authority to define its definition of \"sex\" under Title VII, holding that the EEOC had overstepped its authority. The decision effectively vacated relevant portions of the updated EEOC guidelines.\n\nThis outcome was precisely the one desired by the Trump Administration.",

Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), and with Title VII, which (Texas argued) does not require employers to accommodate sex, but merely requires non-discrimination.\n\nTexas filed the case on August 15, 2024, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, seeking an injunction to stop implementation and enforcement of the 2024 Guidance, because it was not (as it should have been) published in the Federal Register, was contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and exceeded EEOC's statutory rulemaking authority under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nIn October and November 2024, both parties moved for summary judgment. In January 2025, the newly inaugurated President Trump issued several Executive Orders stating there is no federal obligation to avoid discrimination against transgender people. On January 27, 2025, Judge Kacsmaryk ordered the parties to submit a joint brief detailing how new Executive Orders bear on the disposition of the litigation. Pursuant to the court's order, parties submitted the joint brief on February 10, 2025. In this brief, the parties agreed that plaintiffs retained standing and that, even in light of prior Executive Orders, the case was not moot.\n\nOn May 25 2025, Judge Kacsmaryk granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, holding that denial of accommodations for gender non-conforming employees did not constitute actionable discrimination by an employer under Loper Bright. Judge Kacsmaryk further stated that Congress reserved the exclusive authority to define its definition of \"sex\" under Title VII, holding that the EEOC had overstepped its authority. The decision effectively vacated relevant portions of the updated EEOC guidelines.\n\nThis outcome was precisely the one desired by the Trump Administration.",

Tex. 2022).\n\nThis case challenges the EEOC\u2019s April 2024 guidance under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act about workplace harassment of transgender employees. Represented by the Heritage Foundation, Texas contested the EEOC\u2019s interpretation of Title VII; in particular, Texas alleged, the parts of the Guidance about pronouns, bathrooms, and dress codes conflicted with the U.S. Supreme Court's carefully limited holding in Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), and with Title VII, which (Texas argued) does not require employers to accommodate sex, but merely requires non-discrimination.\n\nTexas filed the case on August 15, 2024, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, seeking an injunction to stop implementation and enforcement of the 2024 Guidance, because it was not (as it should have been) published in the Federal Register, was contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and exceeded EEOC's statutory rulemaking authority under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nIn October and November 2024, both parties moved for summary judgment. In January 2025, the newly inaugurated President Trump issued several Executive Orders stating there is no federal obligation to avoid discrimination against transgender people. On January 27, 2025, Judge Kacsmaryk ordered the parties to submit a joint brief detailing how new Executive Orders bear on the disposition of the litigation. Pursuant to the court's order, parties submitted the joint brief on February 10, 2025. In this brief, the parties agreed that plaintiffs retained standing and that, even in light of prior Executive Orders, the case was not moot.\n\nOn May 25 2025, Judge Kacsmaryk granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, holding that denial of accommodations for gender non-conforming employees did not constitute actionable discrimination by an employer under Loper Bright. Judge Kacsmaryk further stated that Congress reserved the exclusive authority to define its definition of \"sex\" under Title VII, holding that the EEOC had overstepped its authority. The decision effectively vacated relevant portions of the updated EEOC guidelines.\n\nThis outcome was precisely the one desired by the Trump Administration.",

Tex. 2022).\n\nThis case challenges the EEOC\u2019s April 2024 guidance under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act about workplace harassment of transgender employees. Represented by the Heritage Foundation, Texas contested the EEOC\u2019s interpretation of Title VII; in particular, Texas alleged, the parts of the Guidance about pronouns, bathrooms, and dress codes conflicted with the U.S. Supreme Court's carefully limited holding in Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), and with Title VII, which (Texas argued) does not require employers to accommodate sex, but merely requires non-discrimination.\n\nTexas filed the case on August 15, 2024, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, seeking an injunction to stop implementation and enforcement of the 2024 Guidance, because it was not (as it should have been) published in the Federal Register, was contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and exceeded EEOC's statutory rulemaking authority under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nIn October and November 2024, both parties moved for summary judgment. In January 2025, the newly inaugurated President Trump issued several Executive Orders stating there is no federal obligation to avoid discrimination against transgender people. On January 27, 2025, Judge Kacsmaryk ordered the parties to submit a joint brief detailing how new Executive Orders bear on the disposition of the litigation. Pursuant to the court's order, parties submitted the joint brief on February 10, 2025. In this brief, the parties agreed that plaintiffs retained standing and that, even in light of prior Executive Orders, the case was not moot.\n\nOn May 25 2025, Judge Kacsmaryk granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, holding that denial of accommodations for gender non-conforming employees did not constitute actionable discrimination by an employer under Loper Bright. Judge Kacsmaryk further stated that Congress reserved the exclusive authority to define its definition of \"sex\" under Title VII, holding that the EEOC had overstepped its authority. The decision effectively vacated relevant portions of the updated EEOC guidelines.\n\nThis outcome was precisely the one desired by the Trump Administration.",
