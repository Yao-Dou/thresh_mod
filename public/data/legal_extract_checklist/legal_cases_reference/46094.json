(To see the Clearinghouse's collection of civil-service-related legal challenges to actions by the second Trump administration, click here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38759&issue_presidential_gubernatorial_authority=38822&ordering=-summary_approved_date].)\n\nOn February 10, 2025, Dellinger filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, the Acting Special Counsel of the OSC, the Chief Operating Officer of the OSC, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Plaintiff was represented by Hecker Fink LLP. Dellinger was appointed by President Joe Biden to a five-year term leading OSC, confirmed by the Senate in March 2024. Under federal statute, he could only be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. On the night of February 7, 2025, Defendants purported to fire Plaintiff from his position in a one-sentence email that made no attempt to comply with the for-cause removal requirement. Plaintiff alleged Defendants' actions violated the Separation of Powers, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Declaratory Judgment Act. Plaintiff requested declaratory judgments, injunctive relief, and all wages and benefits owed to him.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who held a hearing on February 10, 2025. After that hearing, she ordered briefing by the following day, and issued an administrative stay requiring that Dellinger continue to be the Special Counsel through midnight on February 13, 2025, with access to the \"resources or materials of that office.\" The government immediately appealed and sought an emergency stay of the district court order; the appeal was docketed as 25-5025. In its briefing, the government told the Court of Appeals that the President named Doug Collins (the Secretary of Veterans Affairs) as Acting Special Counsel on February 10, 2025. It argued that the district court\u2019s order was \"thus irreparably harming the President by preventing him from installing his preferred designee as the acting head of an Executive Branch agency headed by a single individual.\" The Court of Appeals denied the stay, and dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction on February 12, 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, in the district court, Judge Jackson issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) on February 12, 2025. She noted that the government had not complied with the administrative stay and renewed the order that Dellinger be restored to his Special Counsel role until the court ruled on the request for a preliminary injunction. A hearing was set for February 26, 2025. Defendants again moved for a stay while they appealed; the district court, on February 13, 2025, again rejected the stay, noting its view that the order was non-appealable. On Saturday, February 15, 2025, the Court of Appeals denied a stay and agreed with the district court that the TRO was non-appealable. It issued a full opinion on the matter. Judge Katsas dissented, taking the position that the TRO was appealable and incorrect. The government had requested an expedited ruling from the Court of Appeals so that the Acting Solicitor General \u201chas the opportunity to seek expeditious review from the Supreme Court if this Court denies relief.\u201d\n\nThe next day, February 16, 2025, the government asked the Supreme Court of the United States to vacate the district court order or to issue an administrative stay. On February 21, the Court declined to do so, instead holding the application \"in abeyance\" until February 26, the day the TRO was set to expire. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson noted on the record that they would deny a stay. Justice Gorsuch (joined by Justice Alito) dissented, explaining his view that an equitable order could not direct the appointment or removal of an executive official.\n\nDuring this time, on February 21, 2025, the government filed a motion for summary judgment in the district court. Dellinger filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on February 24.\n\nOn February 26, 2025, in the district court, Judge Jackson extended the TRO through Saturday, March 1, 2025. Then, on March 1, Judge Jackson found for Dellinger, granting summary judgment in his favor and entering a permanent injunction. She wrote:\n\nIn short, the question presented in this case is whether it is an unconstitutional intrusion on the President\u2019s Article II powers to say that he may remove the Special Counsel for reasons related to his performance, but he cannot do it on a whim or out of personal animus. \u00a0It is an extremely narrow question with little or no precedential value given the sui generis nature of the Office of Special Counsel, and the fact that there is no longer any other agency with a single head, protected by similar restrictions, in the executive branch.\n\nThe Court finds that the statute is not unconstitutional. \u00a0And it finds that the elimination of the restrictions on plaintiff\u2019s removal would be fatal to the defining and essential feature of the Office of Special Counsel as it was conceived by Congress and signed into law by the President: \u00a0its independence. \u00a0The Court concludes that they must stand.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal and sought a stay pending appeal on March 1, 2025. District Judge Jackson denied the motion to stay on March 3, 2025, but on March 5, the Court of Appeals granted a stay pending full briefing (to be completed mid-April). Their opinion was filed on March 10. However, on March 12, the appellate court ordered that the briefing schedule be suspended.\n\nAccording to press reports [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/hampton-dellinger-firing.html] and a letter filed with the Court of Appeals, Dellinger gave up his lawsuit the day after their decision (on March 6, 2025). The defendants responded, asserting that the appeal is \"not moot\" and will become moot \"only if and when the permanent injunction from which it arises is dissolved and plaintiff's complaint is dismissed with prejudice.\" Dellinger filed his motion to dismiss the case as moot, with all parties to bear their own costs, on March 7. The motion included, \"Counsel for Dellinger has conferred with counsel for defendants and is authorized to state that defendants oppose this motion.\"\n\nOn March 27, 2025, the Court of Appeals responded with an order (1) granting Dellinger's March 7 motion to dismiss the appeal as moot, (2) granting the request to vacate the district court\u2019s March 1, 2025 memorandum opinion and order, (3) remanding the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the case with prejudice, and (4) denying the request to vacate the appellate court\u2019s March 5, 2025 order and March 10, 2025 opinion included in the reply.\n\nA few days later, on March 31, the district court dismissed the case with prejudice.\n\nThe case is closed.",

It argued that the district court\u2019s order was \"thus irreparably harming the President by preventing him from installing his preferred designee as the acting head of an Executive Branch agency headed by a single individual.\" The Court of Appeals denied the stay, and dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction on February 12, 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, in the district court, Judge Jackson issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) on February 12, 2025.

The defendants responded, asserting that the appeal is \"not moot\" and will become moot \"only if and when the permanent injunction from which it arises is dissolved and plaintiff's complaint is dismissed with prejudice.\" Dellinger filed his motion to dismiss the case as moot, with all parties to bear their own costs, on March 7. The motion included, \"Counsel for Dellinger has conferred with counsel for defendants and is authorized to state that defendants oppose this motion.\"\n\nOn March 27, 2025, the Court of Appeals responded with an order (1) granting Dellinger's March 7 motion to dismiss the appeal as moot, (2) granting the request to vacate the district court\u2019s March 1, 2025 memorandum opinion and order, (3) remanding the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the case with prejudice, and (4) denying the request to vacate the appellate court\u2019s March 5, 2025 order and March 10, 2025 opinion included in the reply.\n\nA few days later, on March 31, the district court dismissed the case with prejudice.\n\nThe case is closed.",

After that hearing, she ordered briefing by the following day, and issued an administrative stay requiring that Dellinger continue to be the Special Counsel through midnight on February 13, 2025, with access to the \"resources or materials of that office.\" The government immediately appealed and sought an emergency stay of the district court order; the appeal was docketed as 25-5025. In its briefing, the government told the Court of Appeals that the President named Doug Collins (the Secretary of Veterans Affairs) as Acting Special Counsel on February 10, 2025. It argued that the district court\u2019s order was \"thus irreparably harming the President by preventing him from installing his preferred designee as the acting head of an Executive Branch agency headed by a single individual.\" The Court of Appeals denied the stay, and dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction on February 12, 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, in the district court, Judge Jackson issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) on February 12, 2025. She noted that the government had not complied with the administrative stay and renewed the order that Dellinger be restored to his Special Counsel role until the court ruled on the request for a preliminary injunction. A hearing was set for February 26, 2025. Defendants again moved for a stay while they appealed; the district court, on February 13, 2025, again rejected the stay, noting its view that the order was non-appealable. On Saturday, February 15, 2025, the Court of Appeals denied a stay and agreed with the district court that the TRO was non-appealable. It issued a full opinion on the matter. Judge Katsas dissented, taking the position that the TRO was appealable and incorrect. The government had requested an expedited ruling from the Court of Appeals so that the Acting Solicitor General \u201chas the opportunity to seek expeditious review from the Supreme Court if this Court denies relief.\u201d\n\nThe next day, February 16, 2025, the government asked the Supreme Court of the United States to vacate the district court order or to issue an administrative stay. On February 21, the Court declined to do so, instead holding the application \"in abeyance\" until February 26, the day the TRO was set to expire. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson noted on the record that they would deny a stay. Justice Gorsuch (joined by Justice Alito) dissented, explaining his view that an equitable order could not direct the appointment or removal of an executive official.\n\nDuring this time, on February 21, 2025, the government filed a motion for summary judgment in the district court. Dellinger filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on February 24.\n\nOn February 26, 2025, in the district court, Judge Jackson extended the TRO through Saturday, March 1, 2025. Then, on March 1, Judge Jackson found for Dellinger, granting summary judgment in his favor and entering a permanent injunction. She wrote:\n\nIn short, the question presented in this case is whether it is an unconstitutional intrusion on the President\u2019s Article II powers to say that he may remove the Special Counsel for reasons related to his performance, but he cannot do it on a whim or out of personal animus. \u00a0It is an extremely narrow question with little or no precedential value given the sui generis nature of the Office of Special Counsel, and the fact that there is no longer any other agency with a single head, protected by similar restrictions, in the executive branch.\n\nThe Court finds that the statute is not unconstitutional. \u00a0And it finds that the elimination of the restrictions on plaintiff\u2019s removal would be fatal to the defining and essential feature of the Office of Special Counsel as it was conceived by Congress and signed into law by the President: \u00a0its independence. \u00a0The Court concludes that they must stand.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal and sought a stay pending appeal on March 1, 2025. District Judge Jackson denied the motion to stay on March 3, 2025, but on March 5, the Court of Appeals granted a stay pending full briefing (to be completed mid-April). Their opinion was filed on March 10. However, on March 12, the appellate court ordered that the briefing schedule be suspended.\n\nAccording to press reports [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/hampton-dellinger-firing.html] and a letter filed with the Court of Appeals, Dellinger gave up his lawsuit the day after their decision (on March 6, 2025). The defendants responded, asserting that the appeal is \"not moot\" and will become moot \"only if and when the permanent injunction from which it arises is dissolved and plaintiff's complaint is dismissed with prejudice.\" Dellinger filed his motion to dismiss the case as moot, with all parties to bear their own costs, on March 7. The motion included, \"Counsel for Dellinger has conferred with counsel for defendants and is authorized to state that defendants oppose this motion.\"\n\nOn March 27, 2025, the Court of Appeals responded with an order (1) granting Dellinger's March 7 motion to dismiss the appeal as moot, (2) granting the request to vacate the district court\u2019s March 1, 2025 memorandum opinion and order, (3) remanding the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the case with prejudice, and (4) denying the request to vacate the appellate court\u2019s March 5, 2025 order and March 10, 2025 opinion included in the reply.\n\nA few days later, on March 31, the district court dismissed the case with prejudice.\n\nThe case is closed.",

Defendants again moved for a stay while they appealed; the district court, on February 13, 2025, again rejected the stay, noting its view that the order was non-appealable. On Saturday, February 15, 2025, the Court of Appeals denied a stay and agreed with the district court that the TRO was non-appealable. It issued a full opinion on the matter. Judge Katsas dissented, taking the position that the TRO was appealable and incorrect.

On February 21, the Court declined to do so, instead holding the application \"in abeyance\" until February 26, the day the TRO was set to expire. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson noted on the record that they would deny a stay. Justice Gorsuch (joined by Justice Alito) dissented, explaining his view that an equitable order could not direct the appointment or removal of an executive official.\n\nDuring this time, on February 21, 2025, the government filed a motion for summary judgment in the district court. Dellinger filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on February 24.\n\nOn February 26, 2025, in the district court, Judge Jackson extended the TRO through Saturday, March 1, 2025. Then, on March 1, Judge Jackson found for Dellinger, granting summary judgment in his favor and entering a permanent injunction. She wrote:\n\nIn short, the question presented in this case is whether it is an unconstitutional intrusion on the President\u2019s Article II powers to say that he may remove the Special Counsel for reasons related to his performance, but he cannot do it on a whim or out of personal animus. \u00a0It is an extremely narrow question with little or no precedential value given the sui generis nature of the Office of Special Counsel, and the fact that there is no longer any other agency with a single head, protected by similar restrictions, in the executive branch.\n\nThe Court finds that the statute is not unconstitutional. \u00a0And it finds that the elimination of the restrictions on plaintiff\u2019s removal would be fatal to the defining and essential feature of the Office of Special Counsel as it was conceived by Congress and signed into law by the President: \u00a0its independence. \u00a0The Court concludes that they must stand.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal and sought a stay pending appeal on March 1, 2025. District Judge Jackson denied the motion to stay on March 3, 2025, but on March 5, the Court of Appeals granted a stay pending full briefing (to be completed mid-April). Their opinion was filed on March 10. However, on March 12, the appellate court ordered that the briefing schedule be suspended.\n\nAccording to press reports [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/hampton-dellinger-firing.html] and a letter filed with the Court of Appeals, Dellinger gave up his lawsuit the day after their decision (on March 6, 2025). The defendants responded, asserting that the appeal is \"not moot\" and will become moot \"only if and when the permanent injunction from which it arises is dissolved and plaintiff's complaint is dismissed with prejudice.\" Dellinger filed his motion to dismiss the case as moot, with all parties to bear their own costs, on March 7. The motion included, \"Counsel for Dellinger has conferred with counsel for defendants and is authorized to state that defendants oppose this motion.\"\n\nOn March 27, 2025, the Court of Appeals responded with an order (1) granting Dellinger's March 7 motion to dismiss the appeal as moot, (2) granting the request to vacate the district court\u2019s March 1, 2025 memorandum opinion and order, (3) remanding the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the case with prejudice, and (4) denying the request to vacate the appellate court\u2019s March 5, 2025 order and March 10, 2025 opinion included in the reply.\n\nA few days later, on March 31, the district court dismissed the case with prejudice.\n\nThe case is closed.",

Trump, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, the Acting Special Counsel of the OSC, the Chief Operating Officer of the OSC, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Plaintiff was represented by Hecker Fink LLP. Dellinger was appointed by President Joe Biden to a five-year term leading OSC, confirmed by the Senate in March 2024. Under federal statute, he could only be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. On the night of February 7, 2025, Defendants purported to fire Plaintiff from his position in a one-sentence email that made no attempt to comply with the for-cause removal requirement. Plaintiff alleged Defendants' actions violated the Separation of Powers, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Declaratory Judgment Act. Plaintiff requested declaratory judgments, injunctive relief, and all wages and benefits owed to him.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who held a hearing on February 10, 2025. After that hearing, she ordered briefing by the following day, and issued an administrative stay requiring that Dellinger continue to be the Special Counsel through midnight on February 13, 2025, with access to the \"resources or materials of that office.\" The government immediately appealed and sought an emergency stay of the district court order; the appeal was docketed as 25-5025. In its briefing, the government told the Court of Appeals that the President named Doug Collins (the Secretary of Veterans Affairs) as Acting Special Counsel on February 10, 2025. It argued that the district court\u2019s order was \"thus irreparably harming the President by preventing him from installing his preferred designee as the acting head of an Executive Branch agency headed by a single individual.\" The Court of Appeals denied the stay, and dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction on February 12, 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, in the district court, Judge Jackson issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) on February 12, 2025.

The motion included, \"Counsel for Dellinger has conferred with counsel for defendants and is authorized to state that defendants oppose this motion.\"\n\nOn March 27, 2025, the Court of Appeals responded with an order (1) granting Dellinger's March 7 motion to dismiss the appeal as moot, (2) granting the request to vacate the district court\u2019s March 1, 2025 memorandum opinion and order, (3) remanding the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the case with prejudice, and (4) denying the request to vacate the appellate court\u2019s March 5, 2025 order and March 10, 2025 opinion included in the reply.\n\nA few days later, on March 31, the district court dismissed the case with prejudice.\n\nThe case is closed.",

    "target": "This is a challenge to the second Trump administration's purported firing of Hampton Dellinger, the head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC), communicated through a one-sentence email that made no attempt to comply with the for-cause removal requirement. (To see the Clearinghouse's collection of civil-service-related legal challenges to actions by the second Trump administration, click here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38759&issue_presidential_gubernatorial_authority=38822&ordering=-summary_approved_date].)\n\nOn February 10, 2025, Dellinger filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, the Acting Special Counsel of the OSC, the Chief Operating Officer of the OSC, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Plaintiff was represented by Hecker Fink LLP. Dellinger was appointed by President Joe Biden to a five-year term leading OSC, confirmed by the Senate in March 2024. Under federal statute, he could only be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. On the night of February 7, 2025, Defendants purported to fire Plaintiff from his position in a one-sentence email that made no attempt to comply with the for-cause removal requirement. Plaintiff alleged Defendants' actions violated the Separation of Powers, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Declaratory Judgment Act. Plaintiff requested declaratory judgments, injunctive relief, and all wages and benefits owed to him.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who held a hearing on February 10, 2025. After that hearing, she ordered briefing by the following day, and issued an administrative stay requiring that Dellinger continue to be the Special Counsel through midnight on February 13, 2025, with access to the \"resources or materials of that office.\" The government immediately appealed and sought an emergency stay of the district court order; the appeal was docketed as 25-5025. In its briefing, the government told the Court of Appeals that the President named Doug Collins (the Secretary of Veterans Affairs) as Acting Special Counsel on February 10, 2025. It argued that the district court\u2019s order was \"thus irreparably harming the President by preventing him from installing his preferred designee as the acting head of an Executive Branch agency headed by a single individual.\" The Court of Appeals denied the stay, and dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction on February 12, 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, in the district court, Judge Jackson issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) on February 12, 2025. She noted that the government had not complied with the administrative stay and renewed the order that Dellinger be restored to his Special Counsel role until the court ruled on the request for a preliminary injunction. A hearing was set for February 26, 2025. Defendants again moved for a stay while they appealed; the district court, on February 13, 2025, again rejected the stay, noting its view that the order was non-appealable. On Saturday, February 15, 2025, the Court of Appeals denied a stay and agreed with the district court that the TRO was non-appealable. It issued a full opinion on the matter. Judge Katsas dissented, taking the position that the TRO was appealable and incorrect. The government had requested an expedited ruling from the Court of Appeals so that the Acting Solicitor General \u201chas the opportunity to seek expeditious review from the Supreme Court if this Court denies relief.\u201d\n\nThe next day, February 16, 2025, the government asked the Supreme Court of the United States to vacate the district court order or to issue an administrative stay. On February 21, the Court declined to do so, instead holding the application \"in abeyance\" until February 26, the day the TRO was set to expire. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson noted on the record that they would deny a stay. Justice Gorsuch (joined by Justice Alito) dissented, explaining his view that an equitable order could not direct the appointment or removal of an executive official.\n\nDuring this time, on February 21, 2025, the government filed a motion for summary judgment in the district court. Dellinger filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on February 24.\n\nOn February 26, 2025, in the district court, Judge Jackson extended the TRO through Saturday, March 1, 2025. Then, on March 1, Judge Jackson found for Dellinger, granting summary judgment in his favor and entering a permanent injunction. She wrote:\n\nIn short, the question presented in this case is whether it is an unconstitutional intrusion on the President\u2019s Article II powers to say that he may remove the Special Counsel for reasons related to his performance, but he cannot do it on a whim or out of personal animus. \u00a0It is an extremely narrow question with little or no precedential value given the sui generis nature of the Office of Special Counsel, and the fact that there is no longer any other agency with a single head, protected by similar restrictions, in the executive branch.\n\nThe Court finds that the statute is not unconstitutional. \u00a0And it finds that the elimination of the restrictions on plaintiff\u2019s removal would be fatal to the defining and essential feature of the Office of Special Counsel as it was conceived by Congress and signed into law by the President: \u00a0its independence. \u00a0The Court concludes that they must stand.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal and sought a stay pending appeal on March 1, 2025. District Judge Jackson denied the motion to stay on March 3, 2025, but on March 5, the Court of Appeals granted a stay pending full briefing (to be completed mid-April). Their opinion was filed on March 10. However, on March 12, the appellate court ordered that the briefing schedule be suspended.\n\nAccording to press reports [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/hampton-dellinger-firing.html] and a letter filed with the Court of Appeals, Dellinger gave up his lawsuit the day after their decision (on March 6, 2025). The defendants responded, asserting that the appeal is \"not moot\" and will become moot \"only if and when the permanent injunction from which it arises is dissolved and plaintiff's complaint is dismissed with prejudice.\" Dellinger filed his motion to dismiss the case as moot, with all parties to bear their own costs, on March 7. The motion included, \"Counsel for Dellinger has conferred with counsel for defendants and is authorized to state that defendants oppose this motion.\"\n\nOn March 27, 2025, the Court of Appeals responded with an order (1) granting Dellinger's March 7 motion to dismiss the appeal as moot, (2) granting the request to vacate the district court\u2019s March 1, 2025 memorandum opinion and order, (3) remanding the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the case with prejudice, and (4) denying the request to vacate the appellate court\u2019s March 5, 2025 order and March 10, 2025 opinion included in the reply.\n\nA few days later, on March 31, the district court dismissed the case with prejudice.\n\nThe case is closed.",

Judge Katsas dissented, taking the position that the TRO was appealable and incorrect. The government had requested an expedited ruling from the Court of Appeals so that the Acting Solicitor General \u201chas the opportunity to seek expeditious review from the Supreme Court if this Court denies relief.\u201d\n\nThe next day, February 16, 2025, the government asked the Supreme Court of the United States to vacate the district court order or to issue an administrative stay. On February 21, the Court declined to do so, instead holding the application \"in abeyance\" until February 26, the day the TRO was set to expire. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson noted on the record that they would deny a stay. Justice Gorsuch (joined by Justice Alito) dissented, explaining his view that an equitable order could not direct the appointment or removal of an executive official.\n\nDuring this time, on February 21, 2025, the government filed a motion for summary judgment in the district court. Dellinger filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on February 24.\n\nOn February 26, 2025, in the district court, Judge Jackson extended the TRO through Saturday, March 1, 2025. Then, on March 1, Judge Jackson found for Dellinger, granting summary judgment in his favor and entering a permanent injunction. She wrote:\n\nIn short, the question presented in this case is whether it is an unconstitutional intrusion on the President\u2019s Article II powers to say that he may remove the Special Counsel for reasons related to his performance, but he cannot do it on a whim or out of personal animus. \u00a0It is an extremely narrow question with little or no precedential value given the sui generis nature of the Office of Special Counsel, and the fact that there is no longer any other agency with a single head, protected by similar restrictions, in the executive branch.\n\nThe Court finds that the statute is not unconstitutional. \u00a0And it finds that the elimination of the restrictions on plaintiff\u2019s removal would be fatal to the defining and essential feature of the Office of Special Counsel as it was conceived by Congress and signed into law by the President: \u00a0its independence. \u00a0The Court concludes that they must stand.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal and sought a stay pending appeal on March 1, 2025. District Judge Jackson denied the motion to stay on March 3, 2025, but on March 5, the Court of Appeals granted a stay pending full briefing (to be completed mid-April). Their opinion was filed on March 10. However, on March 12, the appellate court ordered that the briefing schedule be suspended.\n\nAccording to press reports [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/hampton-dellinger-firing.html] and a letter filed with the Court of Appeals, Dellinger gave up his lawsuit the day after their decision (on March 6, 2025). The defendants responded, asserting that the appeal is \"not moot\" and will become moot \"only if and when the permanent injunction from which it arises is dissolved and plaintiff's complaint is dismissed with prejudice.\" Dellinger filed his motion to dismiss the case as moot, with all parties to bear their own costs, on March 7. The motion included, \"Counsel for Dellinger has conferred with counsel for defendants and is authorized to state that defendants oppose this motion.\"\n\nOn March 27, 2025, the Court of Appeals responded with an order (1) granting Dellinger's March 7 motion to dismiss the appeal as moot, (2) granting the request to vacate the district court\u2019s March 1, 2025 memorandum opinion and order, (3) remanding the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the case with prejudice, and (4) denying the request to vacate the appellate court\u2019s March 5, 2025 order and March 10, 2025 opinion included in the reply.\n\nA few days later, on March 31, the district court dismissed the case with prejudice.\n\nThe case is closed.",

    "target": "This is a challenge to the second Trump administration's purported firing of Hampton Dellinger, the head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC), communicated through a one-sentence email that made no attempt to comply with the for-cause removal requirement. (To see the Clearinghouse's collection of civil-service-related legal challenges to actions by the second Trump administration, click here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38759&issue_presidential_gubernatorial_authority=38822&ordering=-summary_approved_date].)\n\nOn February 10, 2025, Dellinger filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, the Acting Special Counsel of the OSC, the Chief Operating Officer of the OSC, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Plaintiff was represented by Hecker Fink LLP. Dellinger was appointed by President Joe Biden to a five-year term leading OSC, confirmed by the Senate in March 2024. Under federal statute, he could only be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. On the night of February 7, 2025, Defendants purported to fire Plaintiff from his position in a one-sentence email that made no attempt to comply with the for-cause removal requirement. Plaintiff alleged Defendants' actions violated the Separation of Powers, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Declaratory Judgment Act. Plaintiff requested declaratory judgments, injunctive relief, and all wages and benefits owed to him.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who held a hearing on February 10, 2025. After that hearing, she ordered briefing by the following day, and issued an administrative stay requiring that Dellinger continue to be the Special Counsel through midnight on February 13, 2025, with access to the \"resources or materials of that office.\" The government immediately appealed and sought an emergency stay of the district court order; the appeal was docketed as 25-5025. In its briefing, the government told the Court of Appeals that the President named Doug Collins (the Secretary of Veterans Affairs) as Acting Special Counsel on February 10, 2025. It argued that the district court\u2019s order was \"thus irreparably harming the President by preventing him from installing his preferred designee as the acting head of an Executive Branch agency headed by a single individual.\" The Court of Appeals denied the stay, and dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction on February 12, 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, in the district court, Judge Jackson issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) on February 12, 2025. She noted that the government had not complied with the administrative stay and renewed the order that Dellinger be restored to his Special Counsel role until the court ruled on the request for a preliminary injunction. A hearing was set for February 26, 2025. Defendants again moved for a stay while they appealed; the district court, on February 13, 2025, again rejected the stay, noting its view that the order was non-appealable.

Trump, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, the Acting Special Counsel of the OSC, the Chief Operating Officer of the OSC, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Plaintiff was represented by Hecker Fink LLP. Dellinger was appointed by President Joe Biden to a five-year term leading OSC, confirmed by the Senate in March 2024. Under federal statute, he could only be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. On the night of February 7, 2025, Defendants purported to fire Plaintiff from his position in a one-sentence email that made no attempt to comply with the for-cause removal requirement. Plaintiff alleged Defendants' actions violated the Separation of Powers, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Declaratory Judgment Act. Plaintiff requested declaratory judgments, injunctive relief, and all wages and benefits owed to him.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who held a hearing on February 10, 2025. After that hearing, she ordered briefing by the following day, and issued an administrative stay requiring that Dellinger continue to be the Special Counsel through midnight on February 13, 2025, with access to the \"resources or materials of that office.\" The government immediately appealed and sought an emergency stay of the district court order; the appeal was docketed as 25-5025. In its briefing, the government told the Court of Appeals that the President named Doug Collins (the Secretary of Veterans Affairs) as Acting Special Counsel on February 10, 2025. It argued that the district court\u2019s order was \"thus irreparably harming the President by preventing him from installing his preferred designee as the acting head of an Executive Branch agency headed by a single individual.\" The Court of Appeals denied the stay, and dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction on February 12, 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, in the district court, Judge Jackson issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) on February 12, 2025. She noted that the government had not complied with the administrative stay and renewed the order that Dellinger be restored to his Special Counsel role until the court ruled on the request for a preliminary injunction. A hearing was set for February 26, 2025. Defendants again moved for a stay while they appealed; the district court, on February 13, 2025, again rejected the stay, noting its view that the order was non-appealable. On Saturday, February 15, 2025, the Court of Appeals denied a stay and agreed with the district court that the TRO was non-appealable. It issued a full opinion on the matter. Judge Katsas dissented, taking the position that the TRO was appealable and incorrect. The government had requested an expedited ruling from the Court of Appeals so that the Acting Solicitor General \u201chas the opportunity to seek expeditious review from the Supreme Court if this Court denies relief.\u201d\n\nThe next day, February 16, 2025, the government asked the Supreme Court of the United States to vacate the district court order or to issue an administrative stay. On February 21, the Court declined to do so, instead holding the application \"in abeyance\" until February 26, the day the TRO was set to expire. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson noted on the record that they would deny a stay. Justice Gorsuch (joined by Justice Alito) dissented, explaining his view that an equitable order could not direct the appointment or removal of an executive official.\n\nDuring this time, on February 21, 2025, the government filed a motion for summary judgment in the district court. Dellinger filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on February 24.\n\nOn February 26, 2025, in the district court, Judge Jackson extended the TRO through Saturday, March 1, 2025. Then, on March 1, Judge Jackson found for Dellinger, granting summary judgment in his favor and entering a permanent injunction. She wrote:\n\nIn short, the question presented in this case is whether it is an unconstitutional intrusion on the President\u2019s Article II powers to say that he may remove the Special Counsel for reasons related to his performance, but he cannot do it on a whim or out of personal animus. \u00a0It is an extremely narrow question with little or no precedential value given the sui generis nature of the Office of Special Counsel, and the fact that there is no longer any other agency with a single head, protected by similar restrictions, in the executive branch.\n\nThe Court finds that the statute is not unconstitutional. \u00a0And it finds that the elimination of the restrictions on plaintiff\u2019s removal would be fatal to the defining and essential feature of the Office of Special Counsel as it was conceived by Congress and signed into law by the President: \u00a0its independence. \u00a0The Court concludes that they must stand.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal and sought a stay pending appeal on March 1, 2025. District Judge Jackson denied the motion to stay on March 3, 2025, but on March 5, the Court of Appeals granted a stay pending full briefing (to be completed mid-April). Their opinion was filed on March 10. However, on March 12, the appellate court ordered that the briefing schedule be suspended.\n\nAccording to press reports [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/hampton-dellinger-firing.html] and a letter filed with the Court of Appeals, Dellinger gave up his lawsuit the day after their decision (on March 6, 2025). The defendants responded, asserting that the appeal is \"not moot\" and will become moot \"only if and when the permanent injunction from which it arises is dissolved and plaintiff's complaint is dismissed with prejudice.\" Dellinger filed his motion to dismiss the case as moot, with all parties to bear their own costs, on March 7. The motion included, \"Counsel for Dellinger has conferred with counsel for defendants and is authorized to state that defendants oppose this motion.\"\n\nOn March 27, 2025, the Court of Appeals responded with an order (1) granting Dellinger's March 7 motion to dismiss the appeal as moot, (2) granting the request to vacate the district court\u2019s March 1, 2025 memorandum opinion and order, (3) remanding the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the case with prejudice, and (4) denying the request to vacate the appellate court\u2019s March 5, 2025 order and March 10, 2025 opinion included in the reply.\n\nA few days later, on March 31, the district court dismissed the case with prejudice.\n\nThe case is closed.",

She wrote:\n\nIn short, the question presented in this case is whether it is an unconstitutional intrusion on the President\u2019s Article II powers to say that he may remove the Special Counsel for reasons related to his performance, but he cannot do it on a whim or out of personal animus. \u00a0It is an extremely narrow question with little or no precedential value given the sui generis nature of the Office of Special Counsel, and the fact that there is no longer any other agency with a single head, protected by similar restrictions, in the executive branch.\n\nThe Court finds that the statute is not unconstitutional. \u00a0And it finds that the elimination of the restrictions on plaintiff\u2019s removal would be fatal to the defining and essential feature of the Office of Special Counsel as it was conceived by Congress and signed into law by the President: \u00a0its independence. \u00a0The Court concludes that they must stand.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal and sought a stay pending appeal on March 1, 2025. District Judge Jackson denied the motion to stay on March 3, 2025, but on March 5, the Court of Appeals granted a stay pending full briefing (to be completed mid-April). Their opinion was filed on March 10. However, on March 12, the appellate court ordered that the briefing schedule be suspended.\n\nAccording to press reports [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/hampton-dellinger-firing.html] and a letter filed with the Court of Appeals, Dellinger gave up his lawsuit the day after their decision (on March 6, 2025). The defendants responded, asserting that the appeal is \"not moot\" and will become moot \"only if and when the permanent injunction from which it arises is dissolved and plaintiff's complaint is dismissed with prejudice.\" Dellinger filed his motion to dismiss the case as moot, with all parties to bear their own costs, on March 7. The motion included, \"Counsel for Dellinger has conferred with counsel for defendants and is authorized to state that defendants oppose this motion.\"\n\nOn March 27, 2025, the Court of Appeals responded with an order (1) granting Dellinger's March 7 motion to dismiss the appeal as moot, (2) granting the request to vacate the district court\u2019s March 1, 2025 memorandum opinion and order, (3) remanding the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the case with prejudice, and (4) denying the request to vacate the appellate court\u2019s March 5, 2025 order and March 10, 2025 opinion included in the reply.\n\nA few days later, on March 31, the district court dismissed the case with prejudice.\n\nThe case is closed.",
