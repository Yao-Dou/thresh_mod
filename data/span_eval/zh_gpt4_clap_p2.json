Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences , and it is the form of electrical energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances , televisions and electric lamps into a wall socket . A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight . The abbreviations AC and DC are often used to mean simply alternating and direct , as when they modify current or voltage . The usual waveform of alternating current in most electric power circuits is a sine wave . In certain applications , different waveforms are used , such as triangular or square waves . Audio and radio signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current . These types of alternating current carry information encoded ( or modulated ) onto the AC signal , such as sound ( audio ) or images ( video ) . These currents typically alternate at higher frequencies than those used in power transmission .",
