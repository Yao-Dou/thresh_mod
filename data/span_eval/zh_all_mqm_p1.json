An open-label , randomized controlled study was conducted at a tertiary care teaching hospital to compare efficacy and safety of intravenous sodium valproate versus diazepam infusion for control of refractory status epilepticus . Forty children with refractory status epilepticus were randomized to receive either intravenous sodium valproate or diazepam infusion . Refractory status epilepticus was controlled in 80 % of the valproate and 85 % of the diazepam patients . The median time to control refractory status epilepticus was less in the valproate group ( 5 minutes ) than the diazepam group ( 17 minutes ; P $lt; .001 ) . None of the patients in the valproate group required ventilation or developed hypotension , whereas in the diazepam group 60 % required ventilation and 50 % developed hypotension after starting diazepam infusion .
