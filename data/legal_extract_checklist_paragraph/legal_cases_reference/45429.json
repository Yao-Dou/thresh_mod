    "target": "This case is about four non-profit corporations asserting that the City of Colorado Springs held its elections off-cycle in April of odd-numbered years and alleged that this contributed to unlawful racial discrimination and ultimately violated the Voting Rights Act.\n\nOn June 1, 2022, the plaintiffs--the nonprofits Citizens Project, Colorado Latinos Vote, League of Women Voters of the Pikes Peak Region, and Black/Latino Leadership Coalition-- represented by the Election Law Clinic at Harvard Law School, commenced this action in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The plaintiffs argued that the City of Colorado Springs\u2019 timing choice of its elections remains in effect even though Colorado municipalities are now forbidden from adopting it in the first instance and that it is highly unusual among Colorado cities and towns. Additionally, the plaintiffs argued that the Voting Rights Act applies to election timing and may require changes to when elections are held. The plaintiffs argued that the April off-year timing of the Colorado Springs\u2019 municipal elections caused an enormous racial disparity in turnout. As relief, the plaintiffs requested that the Court enter judgment to declare that the timing of the Colorado Springs\u2019 April off-year municipal elections violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, permanently enjoin Colorado Springs from holding future non-November municipal elections, and award plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and costs of suit.\n\nOn July 28, 2023, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment and argued that the plaintiffs did not seek to change the City of Colorado Springs\u2019 election timing through democratic means, no Black or Hispanic resident of the City of Colorado Springs joined the lawsuit, and the City\u2019s Black mayor opposed plaintiffs\u2019 suit. The defendants argued that different election timing falls outside any Section 2 right or remedy. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs lacked a private right of action under Section 2. For these reasons, the defendants argued that the Court should grant defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\n\nOn July 9, 2024, the Court issued an order dismissing plaintiff\u2019s claim for lack of Article III standing and finding as moot defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Court found that the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the matter and dismissed it without prejudice. The Court reasoned that the four non-profit plaintiffs lacked standing because the injuries that they pled were insufficient to confer organizational standing. The Court argued that the plaintiffs have \u201cmanufactured their own standing.\u201d The Court concluded that the plaintiffs lacked Article III standing because they have failed to demonstrate injury in fact. The case is now closed.",

As relief, the plaintiffs requested that the Court enter judgment to declare that the timing of the Colorado Springs\u2019 April off-year municipal elections violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, permanently enjoin Colorado Springs from holding future non-November municipal elections, and award plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and costs of suit.\n\nOn July 28, 2023, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment and argued that the plaintiffs did not seek to change the City of Colorado Springs\u2019 election timing through democratic means, no Black or Hispanic resident of the City of Colorado Springs joined the lawsuit, and the City\u2019s Black mayor opposed plaintiffs\u2019 suit. The defendants argued that different election timing falls outside any Section 2 right or remedy. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs lacked a private right of action under Section 2. For these reasons, the defendants argued that the Court should grant defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\n\nOn July 9, 2024, the Court issued an order dismissing plaintiff\u2019s claim for lack of Article III standing and finding as moot defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Court found that the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the matter and dismissed it without prejudice. The Court reasoned that the four non-profit plaintiffs lacked standing because the injuries that they pled were insufficient to confer organizational standing. The Court argued that the plaintiffs have \u201cmanufactured their own standing.\u201d The Court concluded that the plaintiffs lacked Article III standing because they have failed to demonstrate injury in fact. The case is now closed.",

    "target": "This case is about four non-profit corporations asserting that the City of Colorado Springs held its elections off-cycle in April of odd-numbered years and alleged that this contributed to unlawful racial discrimination and ultimately violated the Voting Rights Act.\n\nOn June 1, 2022, the plaintiffs--the nonprofits Citizens Project, Colorado Latinos Vote, League of Women Voters of the Pikes Peak Region, and Black/Latino Leadership Coalition-- represented by the Election Law Clinic at Harvard Law School, commenced this action in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The plaintiffs argued that the City of Colorado Springs\u2019 timing choice of its elections remains in effect even though Colorado municipalities are now forbidden from adopting it in the first instance and that it is highly unusual among Colorado cities and towns. Additionally, the plaintiffs argued that the Voting Rights Act applies to election timing and may require changes to when elections are held. The plaintiffs argued that the April off-year timing of the Colorado Springs\u2019 municipal elections caused an enormous racial disparity in turnout. As relief, the plaintiffs requested that the Court enter judgment to declare that the timing of the Colorado Springs\u2019 April off-year municipal elections violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, permanently enjoin Colorado Springs from holding future non-November municipal elections, and award plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and costs of suit.\n\nOn July 28, 2023, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment and argued that the plaintiffs did not seek to change the City of Colorado Springs\u2019 election timing through democratic means, no Black or Hispanic resident of the City of Colorado Springs joined the lawsuit, and the City\u2019s Black mayor opposed plaintiffs\u2019 suit. The defendants argued that different election timing falls outside any Section 2 right or remedy. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs lacked a private right of action under Section 2. For these reasons, the defendants argued that the Court should grant defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\n\nOn July 9, 2024, the Court issued an order dismissing plaintiff\u2019s claim for lack of Article III standing and finding as moot defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Court found that the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the matter and dismissed it without prejudice. The Court reasoned that the four non-profit plaintiffs lacked standing because the injuries that they pled were insufficient to confer organizational standing. The Court argued that the plaintiffs have \u201cmanufactured their own standing.\u201d The Court concluded that the plaintiffs lacked Article III standing because they have failed to demonstrate injury in fact.
