They are represented by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the ACLU of Texas, and others. The plaintiffs sued the Governor of Texas and the Texas Secretary of State, alleging that the intent and effect of the redistricting plans were to discriminate against and dilute the voting power of Black, Latino, and Asian American and Pacific Islander voters by cracking and packing minority populations, in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973, as well as the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief ordering defendants to develop redistricting plans that do not dilute minority voting strength and attorneys\u2019 fees. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge David C. Guaderrama.\n\nOn November 19, 2021, the district court consolidated Fair Maps Texas Action Committee v. Abbott with several other pending challenges to Texas\u2019s redistricting plan. The consolidated cases were assigned to a three-judge panel composed of Judges David C. Guaderrama, Jerry E. Smith, and Jeffrey V. Brown. LULAC v. Abbott was designated the lead case.\n\nOn May 23, 2022, the court issued an opinion dismissing many of the Fair Maps plaintiffs' claims. The Section 2 vote dilution claims were dismissed because plaintiffs did not sufficiently allege facts to show that the minority voters were cohesive and that the white majority overwhelmingly voted as a bloc to defeat the minority voters\u2019 candidate of choice. The court also ruled that plaintiffs lacked standing except for claims relating to House Districts 33, 61, 66, and 89; Senate District 22; and Congressional Districts 4, 6, 9, 26, 30, and 33 because none of the plaintiffs resided in the other districts challenged in the complaint.\n\nOn March 24, 2025, the Fair Maps plaintiffs agreed to voluntarily dismiss their remaining claims in the consolidated case. The court\u00a0closed Fair Maps Texas Action Committee v. Abbott and terminated them as parties in Leauge of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) v. Abbott.\n\nThe other Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Defendants remain live; LULAC v. Abbott is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case is about Texas\u2019s redistricting plans for the Texas House (House Plan 2316), Texas Senate (Senate Plan 2168), and for the U.S. House of Representatives (Congressional Plan 2193) following the 2020 census.\n\nOn November 16, 2021, Fair Maps Texas Action Committee, a committee of seven nonprofits supporting equitable redistricting, as well as several other civil rights organizations and individual Texas voters, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. They are represented by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the ACLU of Texas, and others. The plaintiffs sued the Governor of Texas and the Texas Secretary of State, alleging that the intent and effect of the redistricting plans were to discriminate against and dilute the voting power of Black, Latino, and Asian American and Pacific Islander voters by cracking and packing minority populations, in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973, as well as the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief ordering defendants to develop redistricting plans that do not dilute minority voting strength and attorneys\u2019 fees. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge David C. Guaderrama.\n\nOn November 19, 2021, the district court consolidated Fair Maps Texas Action Committee v. Abbott with several other pending challenges to Texas\u2019s redistricting plan. The consolidated cases were assigned to a three-judge panel composed of Judges David C. Guaderrama, Jerry E. Smith, and Jeffrey V. Brown. LULAC v. Abbott was designated the lead case.\n\nOn May 23, 2022, the court issued an opinion dismissing many of the Fair Maps plaintiffs' claims. The Section 2 vote dilution claims were dismissed because plaintiffs did not sufficiently allege facts to show that the minority voters were cohesive and that the white majority overwhelmingly voted as a bloc to defeat the minority voters\u2019 candidate of choice. The court also ruled that plaintiffs lacked standing except for claims relating to House Districts 33, 61, 66, and 89; Senate District 22; and Congressional Districts 4, 6, 9, 26, 30, and 33 because none of the plaintiffs resided in the other districts challenged in the complaint.\n\nOn March 24, 2025, the Fair Maps plaintiffs agreed to voluntarily dismiss their remaining claims in the consolidated case. The court\u00a0closed Fair Maps Texas Action Committee v. Abbott and terminated them as parties in Leauge of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) v. Abbott.\n\nThe other Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Defendants remain live; LULAC v. Abbott is ongoing.",
