You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 8, 2025, two Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State, and the Orange County Correctional Facility, a county prison in New York that contracts with ICE where the petitioners are being held.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the petitioners challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners also filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. The same day the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the Southern District of New York while the case proceeded. A hearing was held on April 9, after which the court issued a TRO. The court converted the plaintiffs' TRO motion to a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) and ordered the respondents to file their response by April 15, with a hearing on the PI motion scheduled for April 22.\n\nAlso on April 9, the Court granted the petitioners' request for class certification. The petitioners filed a request for modification of the class certification on April 10, asking the court to amend the definition of the certified class by \"removing the requirement that class members be in the custody of the United States, to ensure that the class includes individuals subject to the Presidential Proclamation who are in state or local custody.\" The court made the requested modification on April 11 and also amended the TRO to reflect the new class definition.\n\nThe respondents filed a motion to decertify the class on April 21, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction to review and enjoin the federal government's activities at issue in this case; namely, the President's exercise of authority under the AEA.\n\nFollowing the April 22 hearing on the PI motion, the court extended the TRO until the court ruled on the PI motion.\n\nOn May 6, Judge Hellerstein granted the petitioners motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined the government from the following:\n\nEnforcing, in the Southern District of New York, Presidential Proclamation No. 10903, 90 Fed. Reg. 13,033 (2025) entitled \"Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua,\" and are thus prohibited from, inter alia, removing Petitioners, including members of the Certified Class, from the United States, under authority of said Presidential Proclamation.\n\nJudge Hellerstein also ordered the government not to transfer Petitioners including the members of the Certified\u00a0Class from the Southern District of New York.\n\nIn the same hearing, Judge Hellerstein denied the government's April 21 motion to decertify the class, noting:\n\nHere, it is not known how many people in the jurisdiction of this Court may become subject to an order of removal. The issues resolved in this case may have to be resolved over and again as the government removal policy continues. Judicial efficiency, and considerations of due process for individuals yet to be ordered to be removed, support a class action. Moreover, . . . many of the Class members cannot speak English, do not have easy access to counsel, and share common questions.\n\nOn July 9, the government appealed the class certification and preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Case No. 25-1671).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 8, 2025, two Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State, and the Orange County Correctional Facility, a county prison in New York that contracts with ICE where the petitioners are being held.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the petitioners challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review.

On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners also filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. The same day the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the Southern District of New York while the case proceeded. A hearing was held on April 9, after which the court issued a TRO. The court converted the plaintiffs' TRO motion to a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) and ordered the respondents to file their response by April 15, with a hearing on the PI motion scheduled for April 22.\n\nAlso on April 9, the Court granted the petitioners' request for class certification. The petitioners filed a request for modification of the class certification on April 10, asking the court to amend the definition of the certified class by \"removing the requirement that class members be in the custody of the United States, to ensure that the class includes individuals subject to the Presidential Proclamation who are in state or local custody.\" The court made the requested modification on April 11 and also amended the TRO to reflect the new class definition.\n\nThe respondents filed a motion to decertify the class on April 21, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction to review and enjoin the federal government's activities at issue in this case; namely, the President's exercise of authority under the AEA.\n\nFollowing the April 22 hearing on the PI motion, the court extended the TRO until the court ruled on the PI motion.\n\nOn May 6, Judge Hellerstein granted the petitioners motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined the government from the following:\n\nEnforcing, in the Southern District of New York, Presidential Proclamation No. 10903, 90 Fed. Reg. 13,033 (2025) entitled \"Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua,\" and are thus prohibited from, inter alia, removing Petitioners, including members of the Certified Class, from the United States, under authority of said Presidential Proclamation.\n\nJudge Hellerstein also ordered the government not to transfer Petitioners including the members of the Certified\u00a0Class from the Southern District of New York.\n\nIn the same hearing, Judge Hellerstein denied the government's April 21 motion to decertify the class, noting:\n\nHere, it is not known how many people in the jurisdiction of this Court may become subject to an order of removal. The issues resolved in this case may have to be resolved over and again as the government removal policy continues. Judicial efficiency, and considerations of due process for individuals yet to be ordered to be removed, support a class action. Moreover, . . . many of the Class members cannot speak English, do not have easy access to counsel, and share common questions.\n\nOn July 9, the government appealed the class certification and preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Case No. 25-1671).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

The same day the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the Southern District of New York while the case proceeded. A hearing was held on April 9, after which the court issued a TRO. The court converted the plaintiffs' TRO motion to a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) and ordered the respondents to file their response by April 15, with a hearing on the PI motion scheduled for April 22.\n\nAlso on April 9, the Court granted the petitioners' request for class certification. The petitioners filed a request for modification of the class certification on April 10, asking the court to amend the definition of the certified class by \"removing the requirement that class members be in the custody of the United States, to ensure that the class includes individuals subject to the Presidential Proclamation who are in state or local custody.\" The court made the requested modification on April 11 and also amended the TRO to reflect the new class definition.\n\nThe respondents filed a motion to decertify the class on April 21, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction to review and enjoin the federal government's activities at issue in this case; namely, the President's exercise of authority under the AEA.\n\nFollowing the April 22 hearing on the PI motion, the court extended the TRO until the court ruled on the PI motion.\n\nOn May 6, Judge Hellerstein granted the petitioners motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined the government from the following:\n\nEnforcing, in the Southern District of New York, Presidential Proclamation No. 10903, 90 Fed. Reg. 13,033 (2025) entitled \"Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua,\" and are thus prohibited from, inter alia, removing Petitioners, including members of the Certified Class, from the United States, under authority of said Presidential Proclamation.\n\nJudge Hellerstein also ordered the government not to transfer Petitioners including the members of the Certified\u00a0Class from the Southern District of New York.\n\nIn the same hearing, Judge Hellerstein denied the government's April 21 motion to decertify the class, noting:\n\nHere, it is not known how many people in the jurisdiction of this Court may become subject to an order of removal. The issues resolved in this case may have to be resolved over and again as the government removal policy continues. Judicial efficiency, and considerations of due process for individuals yet to be ordered to be removed, support a class action. Moreover, . . . many of the Class members cannot speak English, do not have easy access to counsel, and share common questions.\n\nOn July 9, the government appealed the class certification and preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Case No. 25-1671).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This is one of several challenges to the Trump Administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act (\"AEA\") to circumvent removal procedures and deport Venezuelan nationals without due process. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 8, 2025, two Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State, and the Orange County Correctional Facility, a county prison in New York that contracts with ICE where the petitioners are being held.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the petitioners challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners also filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. The same day the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the Southern District of New York while the case proceeded. A hearing was held on April 9, after which the court issued a TRO. The court converted the plaintiffs' TRO motion to a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) and ordered the respondents to file their response by April 15, with a hearing on the PI motion scheduled for April 22.\n\nAlso on April 9, the Court granted the petitioners' request for class certification. The petitioners filed a request for modification of the class certification on April 10, asking the court to amend the definition of the certified class by \"removing the requirement that class members be in the custody of the United States, to ensure that the class includes individuals subject to the Presidential Proclamation who are in state or local custody.\" The court made the requested modification on April 11 and also amended the TRO to reflect the new class definition.\n\nThe respondents filed a motion to decertify the class on April 21, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction to review and enjoin the federal government's activities at issue in this case; namely, the President's exercise of authority under the AEA.\n\nFollowing the April 22 hearing on the PI motion, the court extended the TRO until the court ruled on the PI motion.\n\nOn May 6, Judge Hellerstein granted the petitioners motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined the government from the following:\n\nEnforcing, in the Southern District of New York, Presidential Proclamation No. 10903, 90 Fed.

    "target": "This is one of several challenges to the Trump Administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act (\"AEA\") to circumvent removal procedures and deport Venezuelan nationals without due process. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 8, 2025, two Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State, and the Orange County Correctional Facility, a county prison in New York that contracts with ICE where the petitioners are being held.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the petitioners challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners also filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. The same day the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the Southern District of New York while the case proceeded. A hearing was held on April 9, after which the court issued a TRO. The court converted the plaintiffs' TRO motion to a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) and ordered the respondents to file their response by April 15, with a hearing on the PI motion scheduled for April 22.\n\nAlso on April 9, the Court granted the petitioners' request for class certification. The petitioners filed a request for modification of the class certification on April 10, asking the court to amend the definition of the certified class by \"removing the requirement that class members be in the custody of the United States, to ensure that the class includes individuals subject to the Presidential Proclamation who are in state or local custody.\" The court made the requested modification on April 11 and also amended the TRO to reflect the new class definition.\n\nThe respondents filed a motion to decertify the class on April 21, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction to review and enjoin the federal government's activities at issue in this case; namely, the President's exercise of authority under the AEA.\n\nFollowing the April 22 hearing on the PI motion, the court extended the TRO until the court ruled on the PI motion.\n\nOn May 6, Judge Hellerstein granted the petitioners motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined the government from the following:\n\nEnforcing, in the Southern District of New York, Presidential Proclamation No. 10903, 90 Fed. Reg. 13,033 (2025) entitled \"Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua,\" and are thus prohibited from, inter alia, removing Petitioners, including members of the Certified Class, from the United States, under authority of said Presidential Proclamation.\n\nJudge Hellerstein also ordered the government not to transfer Petitioners including the members of the Certified\u00a0Class from the Southern District of New York.\n\nIn the same hearing, Judge Hellerstein denied the government's April 21 motion to decertify the class, noting:\n\nHere, it is not known how many people in the jurisdiction of this Court may become subject to an order of removal. The issues resolved in this case may have to be resolved over and again as the government removal policy continues. Judicial efficiency, and considerations of due process for individuals yet to be ordered to be removed, support a class action. Moreover, . . . many of the Class members cannot speak English, do not have easy access to counsel, and share common questions.\n\nOn July 9, the government appealed the class certification and preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Case No. 25-1671).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 8, 2025, two Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State, and the Orange County Correctional Facility, a county prison in New York that contracts with ICE where the petitioners are being held.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the petitioners challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners also filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. The same day the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the Southern District of New York while the case proceeded. A hearing was held on April 9, after which the court issued a TRO. The court converted the plaintiffs' TRO motion to a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) and ordered the respondents to file their response by April 15, with a hearing on the PI motion scheduled for April 22.\n\nAlso on April 9, the Court granted the petitioners' request for class certification. The petitioners filed a request for modification of the class certification on April 10, asking the court to amend the definition of the certified class by \"removing the requirement that class members be in the custody of the United States, to ensure that the class includes individuals subject to the Presidential Proclamation who are in state or local custody.\" The court made the requested modification on April 11 and also amended the TRO to reflect the new class definition.\n\nThe respondents filed a motion to decertify the class on April 21, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction to review and enjoin the federal government's activities at issue in this case; namely, the President's exercise of authority under the AEA.\n\nFollowing the April 22 hearing on the PI motion, the court extended the TRO until the court ruled on the PI motion.\n\nOn May 6, Judge Hellerstein granted the petitioners motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined the government from the following:\n\nEnforcing, in the Southern District of New York, Presidential Proclamation No. 10903, 90 Fed. Reg. 13,033 (2025) entitled \"Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua,\" and are thus prohibited from, inter alia, removing Petitioners, including members of the Certified Class, from the United States, under authority of said Presidential Proclamation.\n\nJudge Hellerstein also ordered the government not to transfer Petitioners including the members of the Certified\u00a0Class from the Southern District of New York.\n\nIn the same hearing, Judge Hellerstein denied the government's April 21 motion to decertify the class, noting:\n\nHere, it is not known how many people in the jurisdiction of this Court may become subject to an order of removal. The issues resolved in this case may have to be resolved over and again as the government removal policy continues. Judicial efficiency, and considerations of due process for individuals yet to be ordered to be removed, support a class action. Moreover, . . . many of the Class members cannot speak English, do not have easy access to counsel, and share common questions.\n\nOn July 9, the government appealed the class certification and preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Case No. 25-1671).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners also filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. The same day the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the Southern District of New York while the case proceeded. A hearing was held on April 9, after which the court issued a TRO. The court converted the plaintiffs' TRO motion to a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) and ordered the respondents to file their response by April 15, with a hearing on the PI motion scheduled for April 22.\n\nAlso on April 9, the Court granted the petitioners' request for class certification. The petitioners filed a request for modification of the class certification on April 10, asking the court to amend the definition of the certified class by \"removing the requirement that class members be in the custody of the United States, to ensure that the class includes individuals subject to the Presidential Proclamation who are in state or local custody.\" The court made the requested modification on April 11 and also amended the TRO to reflect the new class definition.\n\nThe respondents filed a motion to decertify the class on April 21, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction to review and enjoin the federal government's activities at issue in this case; namely, the President's exercise of authority under the AEA.\n\nFollowing the April 22 hearing on the PI motion, the court extended the TRO until the court ruled on the PI motion.\n\nOn May 6, Judge Hellerstein granted the petitioners motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined the government from the following:\n\nEnforcing, in the Southern District of New York, Presidential Proclamation No. 10903, 90 Fed. Reg. 13,033 (2025) entitled \"Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua,\" and are thus prohibited from, inter alia, removing Petitioners, including members of the Certified Class, from the United States, under authority of said Presidential Proclamation.\n\nJudge Hellerstein also ordered the government not to transfer Petitioners including the members of the Certified\u00a0Class from the Southern District of New York.\n\nIn the same hearing, Judge Hellerstein denied the government's April 21 motion to decertify the class, noting:\n\nHere, it is not known how many people in the jurisdiction of this Court may become subject to an order of removal. The issues resolved in this case may have to be resolved over and again as the government removal policy continues. Judicial efficiency, and considerations of due process for individuals yet to be ordered to be removed, support a class action. Moreover, . . . many of the Class members cannot speak English, do not have easy access to counsel, and share common questions.\n\nOn July 9, the government appealed the class certification and preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Case No. 25-1671).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",
