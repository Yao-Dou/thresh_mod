    "target": "This case challenged a rule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that allegedly endangered 24 million Americans' health coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). CMS, which is a subagency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), proposed the challenged rule in March 2025, soon after the Trump Administration took office. The rule, entitled \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Marketplace Integrity and Affordability,\" allegedly added several roadblocks to the acquisition of ACA health insurance; these included new fees, reductions in the enrollment period, and even a revocation of the ACA's central promise that any American can purchase health insurance. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n\nPlaintiffs the City of Columbus, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, the City of Chicago, Doctors for America, and the Main Street Alliance filed this lawsuit on July 1, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuit named HHS, its Secretary, CMS, and its Administrator as defendants. Plaintiffs were represented by Democracy Forward. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the CMS rule was unlawful under the APA; vacatur of the rule; a stay of, and preliminary and permanent injunctions against, the rule's enforcement; and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Brendan Abell Hurson.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion requesting a stay, or alternatively a preliminary injunction, of the new CMS rule. The municipal plaintiffs argued that as healthcare providers of last resort for those who lose insurance under the new rule, the rule would bestow a heavy financial burden on them. The organizational plaintiffs argued that the rule would make it harder for them to pay their employees or to receive adequate compensation for healthcare services rendered.\n\nThe court held a hearing on the requested preliminary injunction on August 14, 2025. On August 22, 2025, it issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion and entering a stay enjoining certain provisions of the CMS rule that were to take effect on August 25. 2025 WL 2426382. It reasoned that the plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their challenges to seven provisions of the rule, but that they failed to show likelihood of success on the merits sufficient to warrant preliminary relief as to their remaining challenges to two other provisions of the rule. As to the seven, the plaintiffs had also shown that they faced irreparable harm \u2013 economic harms that could not adequately be remedied at the conclusion of litigation \u2013 \u00a0and that the balance of the equities and the public interest weighed in favor of a stay.\n\nFirst, the court found that Main Street Alliance and the city plaintiffs had standing based on the increased premiums and uncompensated care costs that would be \"predictable results\" of the challenged provisions. Next, it addressed the plaintiffs\u2019 likelihood of success on the merits of their claims across three categories: (1) challenges to provisions that eroded the value of coverage, including a provision imposing a $5 monthly surcharge to reconfirm eligibility, a provision revising the premium adjustment methodology, and a provision revising the actuarial value policy; (2) challenges to provisions that imposed barriers on enrollment, including a provision requiring enrollees to pay past-due premiums before receiving new coverage and a provision adding verification requirements for some enrollments; and (3) challenges to provisions that limited the availability of subsidized coverage, including a provision re-instituting a policy regarding failure-to-reconcile tax data and two provisions requiring heightened income verification under certain circumstances. \u00a0As to the first category, the court held that CMS lacked authority to impose the challenged fees, which were untethered to the statutory formula, and that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the agency acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by revising the actuarial value policy because it provided an insufficient and conclusory rationale for the changes. However, the court concluded that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their claim that the provision revising premium adjustment methodology was arbitrary and capricious because the agency provided the necessary and reasoned explanation for the changes. As to the second category, the court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their challenge to past-due payment requirements, because the agency was not authorized to create a new exception to the ACA\u2019s categorical guaranteed-issue rule, and to the verification requirements provision because defendants\u2019 rationale for imposing the requirements was not indicative of reasoned decision-making. As to the third category, the court first held that plain text of the ACA contradicted the agency\u2019s failure-to-reconcile provision, and therefore that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the provision was imposed contrary to law. Next considering the agency\u2019s decision to rescind an automatic 60-day extension to reconcile income verification data, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the agency had misinterpreted its modification authority. The court did find, however, that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the agency acted arbitrarily by instituting additional verification requirements for income below the federal poverty line and by rescinding a regulation requiring acceptance of self-attestation of projected household income because those changes were made without sufficient data justifying the need to impose them and in light of the agency\u2019s circular reasoning and conclusory statements offered in support of the changes.\n\nUltimately, the court held that the appropriate course of action was to temporarily stay the seven challenged provisions as to which it found likelihood of success on the merits, postponing the effective date until final resolution of the lawsuit. \u00a0It reasoned that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in\u00a0 CASA  [../../../../case/45965/]\u00a0did not preclude such relief, because that decision did not limit a court\u2019s ability to preliminarily set aside new agency rules under the APA. On August 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to clarify the scope of the preliminary injunction, which the court granted that same day, amending its August 22, 2025 order as clarified to order that the effective dates of the following provisions of the rule were stayed pending resolution of the merits of the case:\n\n\u2022 The imposition of a $5 premium penalty on automatic re-enrollees, through the addition of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.335(a)(3) and (n) and revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.330(j);   \u2022 The revocation of guaranteed insurance coverage for individuals with past-due premiums, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.104(i);   \u2022 The failure to reconcile policy in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.305(f)(4), including the final rule\u2019s amendments to that policy through the addition of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.305(f)(4)(iii);   \u2022 The imposition of eligibility verification for the special enrollment period, through the revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.420(g);   \u2022 The imposition of a requirement that Exchanges verify household income inconsistencies when a tax filer\u2019s attested projected annual household income differs from \u201ctrusted data sources,\u201d through revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.320(c)(3)(iii) and the addition of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.320(c)(3)(vi)(C)(2);   \u2022 The changes to the de minimis ranges for actuarial value calculations, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 156.140(c), 156.200(b)(3), and 156.400;   \u2022 The changes to the policy regarding self-attestation of projected income, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.320(c)(5).\n\nThe effective dates of the following provisions were not stayed:\n\n\u2022 The change to the measure for calculating the premium adjustment percentage set forth in 90 Fed. Reg. 27,166 through 27,178;     \u2022 The elimination of the 60-day extension of time to resolve inconsistencies in household income data, through the removal of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.315(f)(7) and revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.320(c)(5).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged a rule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that allegedly endangered 24 million Americans' health coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). CMS, which is a subagency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), proposed the challenged rule in March 2025, soon after the Trump Administration took office. The rule, entitled \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Marketplace Integrity and Affordability,\" allegedly added several roadblocks to the acquisition of ACA health insurance; these included new fees, reductions in the enrollment period, and even a revocation of the ACA's central promise that any American can purchase health insurance. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n\nPlaintiffs the City of Columbus, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, the City of Chicago, Doctors for America, and the Main Street Alliance filed this lawsuit on July 1, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuit named HHS, its Secretary, CMS, and its Administrator as defendants. Plaintiffs were represented by Democracy Forward. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the CMS rule was unlawful under the APA; vacatur of the rule; a stay of, and preliminary and permanent injunctions against, the rule's enforcement; and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Brendan Abell Hurson.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion requesting a stay, or alternatively a preliminary injunction, of the new CMS rule. The municipal plaintiffs argued that as healthcare providers of last resort for those who lose insurance under the new rule, the rule would bestow a heavy financial burden on them. The organizational plaintiffs argued that the rule would make it harder for them to pay their employees or to receive adequate compensation for healthcare services rendered.\n\nThe court held a hearing on the requested preliminary injunction on August 14, 2025. On August 22, 2025, it issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion and entering a stay enjoining certain provisions of the CMS rule that were to take effect on August 25. 2025 WL 2426382. It reasoned that the plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their challenges to seven provisions of the rule, but that they failed to show likelihood of success on the merits sufficient to warrant preliminary relief as to their remaining challenges to two other provisions of the rule. As to the seven, the plaintiffs had also shown that they faced irreparable harm \u2013 economic harms that could not adequately be remedied at the conclusion of litigation \u2013 \u00a0and that the balance of the equities and the public interest weighed in favor of a stay.\n\nFirst, the court found that Main Street Alliance and the city plaintiffs had standing based on the increased premiums and uncompensated care costs that would be \"predictable results\" of the challenged provisions. Next, it addressed the plaintiffs\u2019 likelihood of success on the merits of their claims across three categories: (1) challenges to provisions that eroded the value of coverage, including a provision imposing a $5 monthly surcharge to reconfirm eligibility, a provision revising the premium adjustment methodology, and a provision revising the actuarial value policy; (2) challenges to provisions that imposed barriers on enrollment, including a provision requiring enrollees to pay past-due premiums before receiving new coverage and a provision adding verification requirements for some enrollments; and (3) challenges to provisions that limited the availability of subsidized coverage, including a provision re-instituting a policy regarding failure-to-reconcile tax data and two provisions requiring heightened income verification under certain circumstances. \u00a0As to the first category, the court held that CMS lacked authority to impose the challenged fees, which were untethered to the statutory formula, and that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the agency acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by revising the actuarial value policy because it provided an insufficient and conclusory rationale for the changes. However, the court concluded that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their claim that the provision revising premium adjustment methodology was arbitrary and capricious because the agency provided the necessary and reasoned explanation for the changes. As to the second category, the court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their challenge to past-due payment requirements, because the agency was not authorized to create a new exception to the ACA\u2019s categorical guaranteed-issue rule, and to the verification requirements provision because defendants\u2019 rationale for imposing the requirements was not indicative of reasoned decision-making. As to the third category, the court first held that plain text of the ACA contradicted the agency\u2019s failure-to-reconcile provision, and therefore that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the provision was imposed contrary to law. Next considering the agency\u2019s decision to rescind an automatic 60-day extension to reconcile income verification data, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the agency had misinterpreted its modification authority. The court did find, however, that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the agency acted arbitrarily by instituting additional verification requirements for income below the federal poverty line and by rescinding a regulation requiring acceptance of self-attestation of projected household income because those changes were made without sufficient data justifying the need to impose them and in light of the agency\u2019s circular reasoning and conclusory statements offered in support of the changes.\n\nUltimately, the court held that the appropriate course of action was to temporarily stay the seven challenged provisions as to which it found likelihood of success on the merits, postponing the effective date until final resolution of the lawsuit. \u00a0It reasoned that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in\u00a0 CASA  [../../../../case/45965/]\u00a0did not preclude such relief, because that decision did not limit a court\u2019s ability to preliminarily set aside new agency rules under the APA. On August 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to clarify the scope of the preliminary injunction, which the court granted that same day, amending its August 22, 2025 order as clarified to order that the effective dates of the following provisions of the rule were stayed pending resolution of the merits of the case:\n\n\u2022 The imposition of a $5 premium penalty on automatic re-enrollees, through the addition of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.335(a)(3) and (n) and revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.330(j);   \u2022 The revocation of guaranteed insurance coverage for individuals with past-due premiums, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.104(i);   \u2022 The failure to reconcile policy in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.305(f)(4), including the final rule\u2019s amendments to that policy through the addition of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.305(f)(4)(iii);   \u2022 The imposition of eligibility verification for the special enrollment period, through the revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.420(g);   \u2022 The imposition of a requirement that Exchanges verify household income inconsistencies when a tax filer\u2019s attested projected annual household income differs from \u201ctrusted data sources,\u201d through revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.320(c)(3)(iii) and the addition of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.320(c)(3)(vi)(C)(2);   \u2022 The changes to the de minimis ranges for actuarial value calculations, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 156.140(c), 156.200(b)(3), and 156.400;   \u2022 The changes to the policy regarding self-attestation of projected income, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.320(c)(5).\n\nThe effective dates of the following provisions were not stayed:\n\n\u2022 The change to the measure for calculating the premium adjustment percentage set forth in 90 Fed. Reg. 27,166 through 27,178;     \u2022 The elimination of the 60-day extension of time to resolve inconsistencies in household income data, through the removal of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.315(f)(7) and revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.320(c)(5).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged a rule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that allegedly endangered 24 million Americans' health coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). CMS, which is a subagency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), proposed the challenged rule in March 2025, soon after the Trump Administration took office. The rule, entitled \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Marketplace Integrity and Affordability,\" allegedly added several roadblocks to the acquisition of ACA health insurance; these included new fees, reductions in the enrollment period, and even a revocation of the ACA's central promise that any American can purchase health insurance. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n\nPlaintiffs the City of Columbus, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, the City of Chicago, Doctors for America, and the Main Street Alliance filed this lawsuit on July 1, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuit named HHS, its Secretary, CMS, and its Administrator as defendants. Plaintiffs were represented by Democracy Forward. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the CMS rule was unlawful under the APA; vacatur of the rule; a stay of, and preliminary and permanent injunctions against, the rule's enforcement; and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Brendan Abell Hurson.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion requesting a stay, or alternatively a preliminary injunction, of the new CMS rule. The municipal plaintiffs argued that as healthcare providers of last resort for those who lose insurance under the new rule, the rule would bestow a heavy financial burden on them. The organizational plaintiffs argued that the rule would make it harder for them to pay their employees or to receive adequate compensation for healthcare services rendered.\n\nThe court held a hearing on the requested preliminary injunction on August 14, 2025. On August 22, 2025, it issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion and entering a stay enjoining certain provisions of the CMS rule that were to take effect on August 25. 2025 WL 2426382. It reasoned that the plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their challenges to seven provisions of the rule, but that they failed to show likelihood of success on the merits sufficient to warrant preliminary relief as to their remaining challenges to two other provisions of the rule. As to the seven, the plaintiffs had also shown that they faced irreparable harm \u2013 economic harms that could not adequately be remedied at the conclusion of litigation \u2013 \u00a0and that the balance of the equities and the public interest weighed in favor of a stay.\n\nFirst, the court found that Main Street Alliance and the city plaintiffs had standing based on the increased premiums and uncompensated care costs that would be \"predictable results\" of the challenged provisions. Next, it addressed the plaintiffs\u2019 likelihood of success on the merits of their claims across three categories: (1) challenges to provisions that eroded the value of coverage, including a provision imposing a $5 monthly surcharge to reconfirm eligibility, a provision revising the premium adjustment methodology, and a provision revising the actuarial value policy; (2) challenges to provisions that imposed barriers on enrollment, including a provision requiring enrollees to pay past-due premiums before receiving new coverage and a provision adding verification requirements for some enrollments; and (3) challenges to provisions that limited the availability of subsidized coverage, including a provision re-instituting a policy regarding failure-to-reconcile tax data and two provisions requiring heightened income verification under certain circumstances. \u00a0As to the first category, the court held that CMS lacked authority to impose the challenged fees, which were untethered to the statutory formula, and that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the agency acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by revising the actuarial value policy because it provided an insufficient and conclusory rationale for the changes. However, the court concluded that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their claim that the provision revising premium adjustment methodology was arbitrary and capricious because the agency provided the necessary and reasoned explanation for the changes. As to the second category, the court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their challenge to past-due payment requirements, because the agency was not authorized to create a new exception to the ACA\u2019s categorical guaranteed-issue rule, and to the verification requirements provision because defendants\u2019 rationale for imposing the requirements was not indicative of reasoned decision-making. As to the third category, the court first held that plain text of the ACA contradicted the agency\u2019s failure-to-reconcile provision, and therefore that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the provision was imposed contrary to law. Next considering the agency\u2019s decision to rescind an automatic 60-day extension to reconcile income verification data, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the agency had misinterpreted its modification authority.

    "target": "This case challenged a rule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that allegedly endangered 24 million Americans' health coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). CMS, which is a subagency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), proposed the challenged rule in March 2025, soon after the Trump Administration took office. The rule, entitled \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Marketplace Integrity and Affordability,\" allegedly added several roadblocks to the acquisition of ACA health insurance; these included new fees, reductions in the enrollment period, and even a revocation of the ACA's central promise that any American can purchase health insurance. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n\nPlaintiffs the City of Columbus, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, the City of Chicago, Doctors for America, and the Main Street Alliance filed this lawsuit on July 1, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuit named HHS, its Secretary, CMS, and its Administrator as defendants. Plaintiffs were represented by Democracy Forward. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the CMS rule was unlawful under the APA; vacatur of the rule; a stay of, and preliminary and permanent injunctions against, the rule's enforcement; and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Brendan Abell Hurson.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion requesting a stay, or alternatively a preliminary injunction, of the new CMS rule. The municipal plaintiffs argued that as healthcare providers of last resort for those who lose insurance under the new rule, the rule would bestow a heavy financial burden on them. The organizational plaintiffs argued that the rule would make it harder for them to pay their employees or to receive adequate compensation for healthcare services rendered.\n\nThe court held a hearing on the requested preliminary injunction on August 14, 2025. On August 22, 2025, it issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion and entering a stay enjoining certain provisions of the CMS rule that were to take effect on August 25. 2025 WL 2426382. It reasoned that the plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their challenges to seven provisions of the rule, but that they failed to show likelihood of success on the merits sufficient to warrant preliminary relief as to their remaining challenges to two other provisions of the rule. As to the seven, the plaintiffs had also shown that they faced irreparable harm \u2013 economic harms that could not adequately be remedied at the conclusion of litigation \u2013 \u00a0and that the balance of the equities and the public interest weighed in favor of a stay.\n\nFirst, the court found that Main Street Alliance and the city plaintiffs had standing based on the increased premiums and uncompensated care costs that would be \"predictable results\" of the challenged provisions. Next, it addressed the plaintiffs\u2019 likelihood of success on the merits of their claims across three categories: (1) challenges to provisions that eroded the value of coverage, including a provision imposing a $5 monthly surcharge to reconfirm eligibility, a provision revising the premium adjustment methodology, and a provision revising the actuarial value policy; (2) challenges to provisions that imposed barriers on enrollment, including a provision requiring enrollees to pay past-due premiums before receiving new coverage and a provision adding verification requirements for some enrollments; and (3) challenges to provisions that limited the availability of subsidized coverage, including a provision re-instituting a policy regarding failure-to-reconcile tax data and two provisions requiring heightened income verification under certain circumstances. \u00a0As to the first category, the court held that CMS lacked authority to impose the challenged fees, which were untethered to the statutory formula, and that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the agency acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by revising the actuarial value policy because it provided an insufficient and conclusory rationale for the changes. However, the court concluded that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their claim that the provision revising premium adjustment methodology was arbitrary and capricious because the agency provided the necessary and reasoned explanation for the changes. As to the second category, the court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their challenge to past-due payment requirements, because the agency was not authorized to create a new exception to the ACA\u2019s categorical guaranteed-issue rule, and to the verification requirements provision because defendants\u2019 rationale for imposing the requirements was not indicative of reasoned decision-making. As to the third category, the court first held that plain text of the ACA contradicted the agency\u2019s failure-to-reconcile provision, and therefore that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the provision was imposed contrary to law. Next considering the agency\u2019s decision to rescind an automatic 60-day extension to reconcile income verification data, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the agency had misinterpreted its modification authority. The court did find, however, that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the agency acted arbitrarily by instituting additional verification requirements for income below the federal poverty line and by rescinding a regulation requiring acceptance of self-attestation of projected household income because those changes were made without sufficient data justifying the need to impose them and in light of the agency\u2019s circular reasoning and conclusory statements offered in support of the changes.\n\nUltimately, the court held that the appropriate course of action was to temporarily stay the seven challenged provisions as to which it found likelihood of success on the merits, postponing the effective date until final resolution of the lawsuit. \u00a0It reasoned that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in\u00a0 CASA  [../../../../case/45965/]\u00a0did not preclude such relief, because that decision did not limit a court\u2019s ability to preliminarily set aside new agency rules under the APA. On August 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to clarify the scope of the preliminary injunction, which the court granted that same day, amending its August 22, 2025 order as clarified to order that the effective dates of the following provisions of the rule were stayed pending resolution of the merits of the case:\n\n\u2022 The imposition of a $5 premium penalty on automatic re-enrollees, through the addition of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.335(a)(3) and (n) and revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.330(j);   \u2022 The revocation of guaranteed insurance coverage for individuals with past-due premiums, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.104(i);   \u2022 The failure to reconcile policy in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.305(f)(4), including the final rule\u2019s amendments to that policy through the addition of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.305(f)(4)(iii);   \u2022 The imposition of eligibility verification for the special enrollment period, through the revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.420(g);   \u2022 The imposition of a requirement that Exchanges verify household income inconsistencies when a tax filer\u2019s attested projected annual household income differs from \u201ctrusted data sources,\u201d through revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.320(c)(3)(iii) and the addition of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.320(c)(3)(vi)(C)(2);   \u2022 The changes to the de minimis ranges for actuarial value calculations, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 156.140(c), 156.200(b)(3), and 156.400;   \u2022 The changes to the policy regarding self-attestation of projected income, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.320(c)(5).\n\nThe effective dates of the following provisions were not stayed:\n\n\u2022 The change to the measure for calculating the premium adjustment percentage set forth in 90 Fed. Reg. 27,166 through 27,178;     \u2022 The elimination of the 60-day extension of time to resolve inconsistencies in household income data, through the removal of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.315(f)(7) and revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.320(c)(5).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged a rule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that allegedly endangered 24 million Americans' health coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). CMS, which is a subagency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), proposed the challenged rule in March 2025, soon after the Trump Administration took office. The rule, entitled \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Marketplace Integrity and Affordability,\" allegedly added several roadblocks to the acquisition of ACA health insurance; these included new fees, reductions in the enrollment period, and even a revocation of the ACA's central promise that any American can purchase health insurance. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n\nPlaintiffs the City of Columbus, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, the City of Chicago, Doctors for America, and the Main Street Alliance filed this lawsuit on July 1, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuit named HHS, its Secretary, CMS, and its Administrator as defendants. Plaintiffs were represented by Democracy Forward. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the CMS rule was unlawful under the APA; vacatur of the rule; a stay of, and preliminary and permanent injunctions against, the rule's enforcement; and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Brendan Abell Hurson.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion requesting a stay, or alternatively a preliminary injunction, of the new CMS rule. The municipal plaintiffs argued that as healthcare providers of last resort for those who lose insurance under the new rule, the rule would bestow a heavy financial burden on them. The organizational plaintiffs argued that the rule would make it harder for them to pay their employees or to receive adequate compensation for healthcare services rendered.\n\nThe court held a hearing on the requested preliminary injunction on August 14, 2025. On August 22, 2025, it issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion and entering a stay enjoining certain provisions of the CMS rule that were to take effect on August 25. 2025 WL 2426382. It reasoned that the plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their challenges to seven provisions of the rule, but that they failed to show likelihood of success on the merits sufficient to warrant preliminary relief as to their remaining challenges to two other provisions of the rule. As to the seven, the plaintiffs had also shown that they faced irreparable harm \u2013 economic harms that could not adequately be remedied at the conclusion of litigation \u2013 \u00a0and that the balance of the equities and the public interest weighed in favor of a stay.\n\nFirst, the court found that Main Street Alliance and the city plaintiffs had standing based on the increased premiums and uncompensated care costs that would be \"predictable results\" of the challenged provisions. Next, it addressed the plaintiffs\u2019 likelihood of success on the merits of their claims across three categories: (1) challenges to provisions that eroded the value of coverage, including a provision imposing a $5 monthly surcharge to reconfirm eligibility, a provision revising the premium adjustment methodology, and a provision revising the actuarial value policy; (2) challenges to provisions that imposed barriers on enrollment, including a provision requiring enrollees to pay past-due premiums before receiving new coverage and a provision adding verification requirements for some enrollments; and (3) challenges to provisions that limited the availability of subsidized coverage, including a provision re-instituting a policy regarding failure-to-reconcile tax data and two provisions requiring heightened income verification under certain circumstances. \u00a0As to the first category, the court held that CMS lacked authority to impose the challenged fees, which were untethered to the statutory formula, and that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the agency acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by revising the actuarial value policy because it provided an insufficient and conclusory rationale for the changes. However, the court concluded that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their claim that the provision revising premium adjustment methodology was arbitrary and capricious because the agency provided the necessary and reasoned explanation for the changes. As to the second category, the court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their challenge to past-due payment requirements, because the agency was not authorized to create a new exception to the ACA\u2019s categorical guaranteed-issue rule, and to the verification requirements provision because defendants\u2019 rationale for imposing the requirements was not indicative of reasoned decision-making. As to the third category, the court first held that plain text of the ACA contradicted the agency\u2019s failure-to-reconcile provision, and therefore that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the provision was imposed contrary to law.

    "target": "This case challenged a rule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that allegedly endangered 24 million Americans' health coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). CMS, which is a subagency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), proposed the challenged rule in March 2025, soon after the Trump Administration took office. The rule, entitled \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Marketplace Integrity and Affordability,\" allegedly added several roadblocks to the acquisition of ACA health insurance; these included new fees, reductions in the enrollment period, and even a revocation of the ACA's central promise that any American can purchase health insurance. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n\nPlaintiffs the City of Columbus, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, the City of Chicago, Doctors for America, and the Main Street Alliance filed this lawsuit on July 1, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuit named HHS, its Secretary, CMS, and its Administrator as defendants. Plaintiffs were represented by Democracy Forward. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the CMS rule was unlawful under the APA; vacatur of the rule; a stay of, and preliminary and permanent injunctions against, the rule's enforcement; and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Brendan Abell Hurson.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion requesting a stay, or alternatively a preliminary injunction, of the new CMS rule. The municipal plaintiffs argued that as healthcare providers of last resort for those who lose insurance under the new rule, the rule would bestow a heavy financial burden on them. The organizational plaintiffs argued that the rule would make it harder for them to pay their employees or to receive adequate compensation for healthcare services rendered.\n\nThe court held a hearing on the requested preliminary injunction on August 14, 2025. On August 22, 2025, it issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion and entering a stay enjoining certain provisions of the CMS rule that were to take effect on August 25. 2025 WL 2426382. It reasoned that the plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their challenges to seven provisions of the rule, but that they failed to show likelihood of success on the merits sufficient to warrant preliminary relief as to their remaining challenges to two other provisions of the rule. As to the seven, the plaintiffs had also shown that they faced irreparable harm \u2013 economic harms that could not adequately be remedied at the conclusion of litigation \u2013 \u00a0and that the balance of the equities and the public interest weighed in favor of a stay.\n\nFirst, the court found that Main Street Alliance and the city plaintiffs had standing based on the increased premiums and uncompensated care costs that would be \"predictable results\" of the challenged provisions. Next, it addressed the plaintiffs\u2019 likelihood of success on the merits of their claims across three categories: (1) challenges to provisions that eroded the value of coverage, including a provision imposing a $5 monthly surcharge to reconfirm eligibility, a provision revising the premium adjustment methodology, and a provision revising the actuarial value policy; (2) challenges to provisions that imposed barriers on enrollment, including a provision requiring enrollees to pay past-due premiums before receiving new coverage and a provision adding verification requirements for some enrollments; and (3) challenges to provisions that limited the availability of subsidized coverage, including a provision re-instituting a policy regarding failure-to-reconcile tax data and two provisions requiring heightened income verification under certain circumstances. \u00a0As to the first category, the court held that CMS lacked authority to impose the challenged fees, which were untethered to the statutory formula, and that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the agency acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by revising the actuarial value policy because it provided an insufficient and conclusory rationale for the changes. However, the court concluded that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their claim that the provision revising premium adjustment methodology was arbitrary and capricious because the agency provided the necessary and reasoned explanation for the changes. As to the second category, the court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their challenge to past-due payment requirements, because the agency was not authorized to create a new exception to the ACA\u2019s categorical guaranteed-issue rule, and to the verification requirements provision because defendants\u2019 rationale for imposing the requirements was not indicative of reasoned decision-making. As to the third category, the court first held that plain text of the ACA contradicted the agency\u2019s failure-to-reconcile provision, and therefore that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the provision was imposed contrary to law. Next considering the agency\u2019s decision to rescind an automatic 60-day extension to reconcile income verification data, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the agency had misinterpreted its modification authority. The court did find, however, that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the agency acted arbitrarily by instituting additional verification requirements for income below the federal poverty line and by rescinding a regulation requiring acceptance of self-attestation of projected household income because those changes were made without sufficient data justifying the need to impose them and in light of the agency\u2019s circular reasoning and conclusory statements offered in support of the changes.\n\nUltimately, the court held that the appropriate course of action was to temporarily stay the seven challenged provisions as to which it found likelihood of success on the merits, postponing the effective date until final resolution of the lawsuit. \u00a0It reasoned that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in\u00a0 CASA  [../../../../case/45965/]\u00a0did not preclude such relief, because that decision did not limit a court\u2019s ability to preliminarily set aside new agency rules under the APA.

    "target": "This case challenged a rule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that allegedly endangered 24 million Americans' health coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). CMS, which is a subagency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), proposed the challenged rule in March 2025, soon after the Trump Administration took office. The rule, entitled \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Marketplace Integrity and Affordability,\" allegedly added several roadblocks to the acquisition of ACA health insurance; these included new fees, reductions in the enrollment period, and even a revocation of the ACA's central promise that any American can purchase health insurance. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n\nPlaintiffs the City of Columbus, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, the City of Chicago, Doctors for America, and the Main Street Alliance filed this lawsuit on July 1, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuit named HHS, its Secretary, CMS, and its Administrator as defendants. Plaintiffs were represented by Democracy Forward. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the CMS rule was unlawful under the APA; vacatur of the rule; a stay of, and preliminary and permanent injunctions against, the rule's enforcement; and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Brendan Abell Hurson.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion requesting a stay, or alternatively a preliminary injunction, of the new CMS rule. The municipal plaintiffs argued that as healthcare providers of last resort for those who lose insurance under the new rule, the rule would bestow a heavy financial burden on them. The organizational plaintiffs argued that the rule would make it harder for them to pay their employees or to receive adequate compensation for healthcare services rendered.\n\nThe court held a hearing on the requested preliminary injunction on August 14, 2025. On August 22, 2025, it issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion and entering a stay enjoining certain provisions of the CMS rule that were to take effect on August 25. 2025 WL 2426382. It reasoned that the plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their challenges to seven provisions of the rule, but that they failed to show likelihood of success on the merits sufficient to warrant preliminary relief as to their remaining challenges to two other provisions of the rule. As to the seven, the plaintiffs had also shown that they faced irreparable harm \u2013 economic harms that could not adequately be remedied at the conclusion of litigation \u2013 \u00a0and that the balance of the equities and the public interest weighed in favor of a stay.\n\nFirst, the court found that Main Street Alliance and the city plaintiffs had standing based on the increased premiums and uncompensated care costs that would be \"predictable results\" of the challenged provisions. Next, it addressed the plaintiffs\u2019 likelihood of success on the merits of their claims across three categories: (1) challenges to provisions that eroded the value of coverage, including a provision imposing a $5 monthly surcharge to reconfirm eligibility, a provision revising the premium adjustment methodology, and a provision revising the actuarial value policy; (2) challenges to provisions that imposed barriers on enrollment, including a provision requiring enrollees to pay past-due premiums before receiving new coverage and a provision adding verification requirements for some enrollments; and (3) challenges to provisions that limited the availability of subsidized coverage, including a provision re-instituting a policy regarding failure-to-reconcile tax data and two provisions requiring heightened income verification under certain circumstances. \u00a0As to the first category, the court held that CMS lacked authority to impose the challenged fees, which were untethered to the statutory formula, and that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the agency acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by revising the actuarial value policy because it provided an insufficient and conclusory rationale for the changes. However, the court concluded that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their claim that the provision revising premium adjustment methodology was arbitrary and capricious because the agency provided the necessary and reasoned explanation for the changes. As to the second category, the court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their challenge to past-due payment requirements, because the agency was not authorized to create a new exception to the ACA\u2019s categorical guaranteed-issue rule, and to the verification requirements provision because defendants\u2019 rationale for imposing the requirements was not indicative of reasoned decision-making. As to the third category, the court first held that plain text of the ACA contradicted the agency\u2019s failure-to-reconcile provision, and therefore that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the provision was imposed contrary to law. Next considering the agency\u2019s decision to rescind an automatic 60-day extension to reconcile income verification data, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the agency had misinterpreted its modification authority. The court did find, however, that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the agency acted arbitrarily by instituting additional verification requirements for income below the federal poverty line and by rescinding a regulation requiring acceptance of self-attestation of projected household income because those changes were made without sufficient data justifying the need to impose them and in light of the agency\u2019s circular reasoning and conclusory statements offered in support of the changes.\n\nUltimately, the court held that the appropriate course of action was to temporarily stay the seven challenged provisions as to which it found likelihood of success on the merits, postponing the effective date until final resolution of the lawsuit. \u00a0It reasoned that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in\u00a0 CASA  [../../../../case/45965/]\u00a0did not preclude such relief, because that decision did not limit a court\u2019s ability to preliminarily set aside new agency rules under the APA. On August 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to clarify the scope of the preliminary injunction, which the court granted that same day, amending its August 22, 2025 order as clarified to order that the effective dates of the following provisions of the rule were stayed pending resolution of the merits of the case:\n\n\u2022 The imposition of a $5 premium penalty on automatic re-enrollees, through the addition of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.335(a)(3) and (n) and revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.330(j);   \u2022 The revocation of guaranteed insurance coverage for individuals with past-due premiums, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.104(i);   \u2022 The failure to reconcile policy in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.305(f)(4), including the final rule\u2019s amendments to that policy through the addition of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.305(f)(4)(iii);   \u2022 The imposition of eligibility verification for the special enrollment period, through the revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.420(g);   \u2022 The imposition of a requirement that Exchanges verify household income inconsistencies when a tax filer\u2019s attested projected annual household income differs from \u201ctrusted data sources,\u201d through revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.320(c)(3)(iii) and the addition of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.320(c)(3)(vi)(C)(2);   \u2022 The changes to the de minimis ranges for actuarial value calculations, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 156.140(c), 156.200(b)(3), and 156.400;   \u2022 The changes to the policy regarding self-attestation of projected income, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.320(c)(5).\n\nThe effective dates of the following provisions were not stayed:\n\n\u2022 The change to the measure for calculating the premium adjustment percentage set forth in 90 Fed. Reg. 27,166 through 27,178;     \u2022 The elimination of the 60-day extension of time to resolve inconsistencies in household income data, through the removal of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.315(f)(7) and revisions to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.320(c)(5).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",
