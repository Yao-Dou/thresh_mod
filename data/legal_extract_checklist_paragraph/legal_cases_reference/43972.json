    "target": "This case is about the First Amendment rights of public officials. On August 4, 2022, the Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, promulgated Executive Order 22-176, suspending a State Attorney after he signed on to statements in support of transgender rights and abortion rights.\u00a0The Executive Order (EO) claimed the State Attorney was \"incompetent\" to hold his office and had demonstrated a \"neglect of duty\" while in office. However, Governor DeSantis stated to the press that the suspension was due to statements the State Attorney had made about gender-affirming care and abortion.\n\nFollowing his suspension, the State Attorney filed this lawsuit against Governor DeSantis on August 17, 2022, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. The plaintiff sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that the suspension violated his First Amendment right to free speech and the Florida Constitution's limitations on gubernatorial suspensions of state officers. Various parties filed amicus briefs in this case, including a group of former prosecutors, attorneys general, judges, US attorneys, and other officials (for the plaintiff); two groups of legal scholars (for the plaintiff); and the Florida Sheriff's Association (for the defendant).\n\nOn the same day he filed the lawsuit, the plaintiff also moved for a preliminary injunction requiring the Governor to reinstate the plaintiff as a State Attorney. The Governor subsequently moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the plaintiff's speech was the speech of a government officials pursuant to his duties; under Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410 (2006), an official's supervisor can discipline them for official speech without violating the First Amendment.\n\nOn September 29, 2022, the court denied the Governor's motion to dismiss the First Amendment claim, holding that\u00a0Garcetti\u00a0did not apply because 1) the plaintiff was elected, and 2) the speech at issue was not official. However, the court dismissed the plaintiff's state law claim as barred by sovereign immunity. The court also denied the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction, finding that restoring the plaintiff to his State Attorney position could cause disruption in the government, and that the success of plaintiff's claim would hinge on the facts of the case. Finally, the court held that it should not abstain from hearing the case under either Pullman or Younger. 631 F.Supp.3d 1188.\n\nThe Governor filed a motion for interlocutory judgment under Section 1292(b), requesting that the district court certify the First Amendment issue so it could be immediately appealed. On October 4, 2022, the court denied the Governor's motion for certification as a matter of discretion. 2022 WL 19395252.\n\nThe court held a bench trial from November 29 to December 1, 2022. On January 20, 2023, Judge Hinkle entered a judgment on the merits. The court found that the Governor violated the First Amendment by suspending the plaintiff for speech on matters of public concern and for his association with the Democratic Party. However, the plaintiff was not entitled to be reinstated, as the court found that the Governor would have suspended the plaintiff anyway due to unprotected activities, including the plaintiff's statement opposing abortion prosecutions, the policy reforms the plaintiff enacted, and the political benefit that the Governor would get from suspending him. The Court also held that the suspension violated the Florida Constitution because it was not based on neglect of duty or incompetence. However, Florida's sovereign immunity prevented any relief on this basis. Therefore, the court dismissed the case. 653 F.Supp.3d 1118.\n\nOn February 14, 2023, the plaintiff appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals (docket no. 23-10459). The motion to expedite the appeal was granted on March 3, and the Court of Appeals scheduled oral arguments for May 2, 2023. In his pleading, the plaintiff argued that the district court had erred in holding that sovereign immunity barred it from ordering reinstatement, and that the court had misapplied the legal framework for First Amendment retaliation claims.\n\nOn January 11, 2024, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court's decision and remanded the case. The Eleventh Circuit held that two factors in the Governor's suspension decision\u2014the abortion statement and the political benefit to the Governor\u2014were protected by the First Amendment, though the district court had considered them unprotected. Therefore, the Eleventh Circuit remanded the case so that the district court could analyze whether the Governor would have made the same suspension decision if none of the protected factors were present. 90 F.4th 1115.\n\nThe Governor subsequently petitioned for rehearing en banc. While the Eleventh Circuit considered whether to grant the petition, the plaintiff's term of office as State Attorney concluded. On January 1, 2025, the Eleventh Circuit vacated its previous opinion, holding that the case was now moot because the court could not provide the plaintiff meaningful relief. The Court rejected the plaintiff's argument that the case fell into an exception for cases \"capable of repetition yet evading review\" because the plaintiff had not shown a likelihood that he would subsequently run for and win another public office that the governor would suspend him from. 125 F.4th 1361.\n\nThe case was subsequently dismissed, and is now closed.",

    "target": "This case is about the First Amendment rights of public officials. On August 4, 2022, the Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, promulgated Executive Order 22-176, suspending a State Attorney after he signed on to statements in support of transgender rights and abortion rights.\u00a0The Executive Order (EO) claimed the State Attorney was \"incompetent\" to hold his office and had demonstrated a \"neglect of duty\" while in office. However, Governor DeSantis stated to the press that the suspension was due to statements the State Attorney had made about gender-affirming care and abortion.\n\nFollowing his suspension, the State Attorney filed this lawsuit against Governor DeSantis on August 17, 2022, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. The plaintiff sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that the suspension violated his First Amendment right to free speech and the Florida Constitution's limitations on gubernatorial suspensions of state officers. Various parties filed amicus briefs in this case, including a group of former prosecutors, attorneys general, judges, US attorneys, and other officials (for the plaintiff); two groups of legal scholars (for the plaintiff); and the Florida Sheriff's Association (for the defendant).\n\nOn the same day he filed the lawsuit, the plaintiff also moved for a preliminary injunction requiring the Governor to reinstate the plaintiff as a State Attorney. The Governor subsequently moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the plaintiff's speech was the speech of a government officials pursuant to his duties; under Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410 (2006), an official's supervisor can discipline them for official speech without violating the First Amendment.\n\nOn September 29, 2022, the court denied the Governor's motion to dismiss the First Amendment claim, holding that\u00a0Garcetti\u00a0did not apply because 1) the plaintiff was elected, and 2) the speech at issue was not official. However, the court dismissed the plaintiff's state law claim as barred by sovereign immunity. The court also denied the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction, finding that restoring the plaintiff to his State Attorney position could cause disruption in the government, and that the success of plaintiff's claim would hinge on the facts of the case. Finally, the court held that it should not abstain from hearing the case under either Pullman or Younger. 631 F.Supp.3d 1188.\n\nThe Governor filed a motion for interlocutory judgment under Section 1292(b), requesting that the district court certify the First Amendment issue so it could be immediately appealed. On October 4, 2022, the court denied the Governor's motion for certification as a matter of discretion. 2022 WL 19395252.\n\nThe court held a bench trial from November 29 to December 1, 2022. On January 20, 2023, Judge Hinkle entered a judgment on the merits. The court found that the Governor violated the First Amendment by suspending the plaintiff for speech on matters of public concern and for his association with the Democratic Party. However, the plaintiff was not entitled to be reinstated, as the court found that the Governor would have suspended the plaintiff anyway due to unprotected activities, including the plaintiff's statement opposing abortion prosecutions, the policy reforms the plaintiff enacted, and the political benefit that the Governor would get from suspending him. The Court also held that the suspension violated the Florida Constitution because it was not based on neglect of duty or incompetence. However, Florida's sovereign immunity prevented any relief on this basis. Therefore, the court dismissed the case. 653 F.Supp.3d 1118.\n\nOn February 14, 2023, the plaintiff appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals (docket no. 23-10459). The motion to expedite the appeal was granted on March 3, and the Court of Appeals scheduled oral arguments for May 2, 2023. In his pleading, the plaintiff argued that the district court had erred in holding that sovereign immunity barred it from ordering reinstatement, and that the court had misapplied the legal framework for First Amendment retaliation claims.\n\nOn January 11, 2024, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court's decision and remanded the case. The Eleventh Circuit held that two factors in the Governor's suspension decision\u2014the abortion statement and the political benefit to the Governor\u2014were protected by the First Amendment, though the district court had considered them unprotected. Therefore, the Eleventh Circuit remanded the case so that the district court could analyze whether the Governor would have made the same suspension decision if none of the protected factors were present. 90 F.4th 1115.\n\nThe Governor subsequently petitioned for rehearing en banc. While the Eleventh Circuit considered whether to grant the petition, the plaintiff's term of office as State Attorney concluded. On January 1, 2025, the Eleventh Circuit vacated its previous opinion, holding that the case was now moot because the court could not provide the plaintiff meaningful relief. The Court rejected the plaintiff's argument that the case fell into an exception for cases \"capable of repetition yet evading review\" because the plaintiff had not shown a likelihood that he would subsequently run for and win another public office that the governor would suspend him from. 125 F.4th 1361.\n\nThe case was subsequently dismissed, and is now closed.",

The court found that the Governor violated the First Amendment by suspending the plaintiff for speech on matters of public concern and for his association with the Democratic Party. However, the plaintiff was not entitled to be reinstated, as the court found that the Governor would have suspended the plaintiff anyway due to unprotected activities, including the plaintiff's statement opposing abortion prosecutions, the policy reforms the plaintiff enacted, and the political benefit that the Governor would get from suspending him. The Court also held that the suspension violated the Florida Constitution because it was not based on neglect of duty or incompetence. However, Florida's sovereign immunity prevented any relief on this basis. Therefore, the court dismissed the case. 653 F.Supp.3d 1118.\n\nOn February 14, 2023, the plaintiff appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals (docket no. 23-10459). The motion to expedite the appeal was granted on March 3, and the Court of Appeals scheduled oral arguments for May 2, 2023. In his pleading, the plaintiff argued that the district court had erred in holding that sovereign immunity barred it from ordering reinstatement, and that the court had misapplied the legal framework for First Amendment retaliation claims.\n\nOn January 11, 2024, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court's decision and remanded the case. The Eleventh Circuit held that two factors in the Governor's suspension decision\u2014the abortion statement and the political benefit to the Governor\u2014were protected by the First Amendment, though the district court had considered them unprotected.

    "target": "This case is about the First Amendment rights of public officials. On August 4, 2022, the Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, promulgated Executive Order 22-176, suspending a State Attorney after he signed on to statements in support of transgender rights and abortion rights.\u00a0The Executive Order (EO) claimed the State Attorney was \"incompetent\" to hold his office and had demonstrated a \"neglect of duty\" while in office. However, Governor DeSantis stated to the press that the suspension was due to statements the State Attorney had made about gender-affirming care and abortion.\n\nFollowing his suspension, the State Attorney filed this lawsuit against Governor DeSantis on August 17, 2022, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. The plaintiff sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that the suspension violated his First Amendment right to free speech and the Florida Constitution's limitations on gubernatorial suspensions of state officers. Various parties filed amicus briefs in this case, including a group of former prosecutors, attorneys general, judges, US attorneys, and other officials (for the plaintiff); two groups of legal scholars (for the plaintiff); and the Florida Sheriff's Association (for the defendant).\n\nOn the same day he filed the lawsuit, the plaintiff also moved for a preliminary injunction requiring the Governor to reinstate the plaintiff as a State Attorney. The Governor subsequently moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the plaintiff's speech was the speech of a government officials pursuant to his duties; under Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410 (2006), an official's supervisor can discipline them for official speech without violating the First Amendment.\n\nOn September 29, 2022, the court denied the Governor's motion to dismiss the First Amendment claim, holding that\u00a0Garcetti\u00a0did not apply because 1) the plaintiff was elected, and 2) the speech at issue was not official. However, the court dismissed the plaintiff's state law claim as barred by sovereign immunity. The court also denied the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction, finding that restoring the plaintiff to his State Attorney position could cause disruption in the government, and that the success of plaintiff's claim would hinge on the facts of the case. Finally, the court held that it should not abstain from hearing the case under either Pullman or Younger. 631 F.Supp.3d 1188.\n\nThe Governor filed a motion for interlocutory judgment under Section 1292(b), requesting that the district court certify the First Amendment issue so it could be immediately appealed.

    "target": "This case is about the First Amendment rights of public officials. On August 4, 2022, the Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, promulgated Executive Order 22-176, suspending a State Attorney after he signed on to statements in support of transgender rights and abortion rights.\u00a0The Executive Order (EO) claimed the State Attorney was \"incompetent\" to hold his office and had demonstrated a \"neglect of duty\" while in office. However, Governor DeSantis stated to the press that the suspension was due to statements the State Attorney had made about gender-affirming care and abortion.\n\nFollowing his suspension, the State Attorney filed this lawsuit against Governor DeSantis on August 17, 2022, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. The plaintiff sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that the suspension violated his First Amendment right to free speech and the Florida Constitution's limitations on gubernatorial suspensions of state officers. Various parties filed amicus briefs in this case, including a group of former prosecutors, attorneys general, judges, US attorneys, and other officials (for the plaintiff); two groups of legal scholars (for the plaintiff); and the Florida Sheriff's Association (for the defendant).\n\nOn the same day he filed the lawsuit, the plaintiff also moved for a preliminary injunction requiring the Governor to reinstate the plaintiff as a State Attorney. The Governor subsequently moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the plaintiff's speech was the speech of a government officials pursuant to his duties; under Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410 (2006), an official's supervisor can discipline them for official speech without violating the First Amendment.\n\nOn September 29, 2022, the court denied the Governor's motion to dismiss the First Amendment claim, holding that\u00a0Garcetti\u00a0did not apply because 1) the plaintiff was elected, and 2) the speech at issue was not official. However, the court dismissed the plaintiff's state law claim as barred by sovereign immunity. The court also denied the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction, finding that restoring the plaintiff to his State Attorney position could cause disruption in the government, and that the success of plaintiff's claim would hinge on the facts of the case. Finally, the court held that it should not abstain from hearing the case under either Pullman or Younger. 631 F.Supp.3d 1188.\n\nThe Governor filed a motion for interlocutory judgment under Section 1292(b), requesting that the district court certify the First Amendment issue so it could be immediately appealed. On October 4, 2022, the court denied the Governor's motion for certification as a matter of discretion. 2022 WL 19395252.\n\nThe court held a bench trial from November 29 to December 1, 2022. On January 20, 2023, Judge Hinkle entered a judgment on the merits. The court found that the Governor violated the First Amendment by suspending the plaintiff for speech on matters of public concern and for his association with the Democratic Party. However, the plaintiff was not entitled to be reinstated, as the court found that the Governor would have suspended the plaintiff anyway due to unprotected activities, including the plaintiff's statement opposing abortion prosecutions, the policy reforms the plaintiff enacted, and the political benefit that the Governor would get from suspending him. The Court also held that the suspension violated the Florida Constitution because it was not based on neglect of duty or incompetence. However, Florida's sovereign immunity prevented any relief on this basis. Therefore, the court dismissed the case. 653 F.Supp.3d 1118.\n\nOn February 14, 2023, the plaintiff appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals (docket no. 23-10459). The motion to expedite the appeal was granted on March 3, and the Court of Appeals scheduled oral arguments for May 2, 2023. In his pleading, the plaintiff argued that the district court had erred in holding that sovereign immunity barred it from ordering reinstatement, and that the court had misapplied the legal framework for First Amendment retaliation claims.\n\nOn January 11, 2024, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court's decision and remanded the case. The Eleventh Circuit held that two factors in the Governor's suspension decision\u2014the abortion statement and the political benefit to the Governor\u2014were protected by the First Amendment, though the district court had considered them unprotected. Therefore, the Eleventh Circuit remanded the case so that the district court could analyze whether the Governor would have made the same suspension decision if none of the protected factors were present. 90 F.4th 1115.\n\nThe Governor subsequently petitioned for rehearing en banc. While the Eleventh Circuit considered whether to grant the petition, the plaintiff's term of office as State Attorney concluded. On January 1, 2025, the Eleventh Circuit vacated its previous opinion, holding that the case was now moot because the court could not provide the plaintiff meaningful relief. The Court rejected the plaintiff's argument that the case fell into an exception for cases \"capable of repetition yet evading review\" because the plaintiff had not shown a likelihood that he would subsequently run for and win another public office that the governor would suspend him from. 125 F.4th 1361.\n\nThe case was subsequently dismissed, and is now closed.",

    "target": "This case is about the First Amendment rights of public officials. On August 4, 2022, the Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, promulgated Executive Order 22-176, suspending a State Attorney after he signed on to statements in support of transgender rights and abortion rights.\u00a0The Executive Order (EO) claimed the State Attorney was \"incompetent\" to hold his office and had demonstrated a \"neglect of duty\" while in office. However, Governor DeSantis stated to the press that the suspension was due to statements the State Attorney had made about gender-affirming care and abortion.\n\nFollowing his suspension, the State Attorney filed this lawsuit against Governor DeSantis on August 17, 2022, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. The plaintiff sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that the suspension violated his First Amendment right to free speech and the Florida Constitution's limitations on gubernatorial suspensions of state officers. Various parties filed amicus briefs in this case, including a group of former prosecutors, attorneys general, judges, US attorneys, and other officials (for the plaintiff); two groups of legal scholars (for the plaintiff); and the Florida Sheriff's Association (for the defendant).\n\nOn the same day he filed the lawsuit, the plaintiff also moved for a preliminary injunction requiring the Governor to reinstate the plaintiff as a State Attorney. The Governor subsequently moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the plaintiff's speech was the speech of a government officials pursuant to his duties; under Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410 (2006), an official's supervisor can discipline them for official speech without violating the First Amendment.\n\nOn September 29, 2022, the court denied the Governor's motion to dismiss the First Amendment claim, holding that\u00a0Garcetti\u00a0did not apply because 1) the plaintiff was elected, and 2) the speech at issue was not official. However, the court dismissed the plaintiff's state law claim as barred by sovereign immunity. The court also denied the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction, finding that restoring the plaintiff to his State Attorney position could cause disruption in the government, and that the success of plaintiff's claim would hinge on the facts of the case. Finally, the court held that it should not abstain from hearing the case under either Pullman or Younger. 631 F.Supp.3d 1188.\n\nThe Governor filed a motion for interlocutory judgment under Section 1292(b), requesting that the district court certify the First Amendment issue so it could be immediately appealed. On October 4, 2022, the court denied the Governor's motion for certification as a matter of discretion. 2022 WL 19395252.\n\nThe court held a bench trial from November 29 to December 1, 2022. On January 20, 2023, Judge Hinkle entered a judgment on the merits. The court found that the Governor violated the First Amendment by suspending the plaintiff for speech on matters of public concern and for his association with the Democratic Party. However, the plaintiff was not entitled to be reinstated, as the court found that the Governor would have suspended the plaintiff anyway due to unprotected activities, including the plaintiff's statement opposing abortion prosecutions, the policy reforms the plaintiff enacted, and the political benefit that the Governor would get from suspending him. The Court also held that the suspension violated the Florida Constitution because it was not based on neglect of duty or incompetence. However, Florida's sovereign immunity prevented any relief on this basis. Therefore, the court dismissed the case. 653 F.Supp.3d 1118.\n\nOn February 14, 2023, the plaintiff appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals (docket no. 23-10459). The motion to expedite the appeal was granted on March 3, and the Court of Appeals scheduled oral arguments for May 2, 2023. In his pleading, the plaintiff argued that the district court had erred in holding that sovereign immunity barred it from ordering reinstatement, and that the court had misapplied the legal framework for First Amendment retaliation claims.\n\nOn January 11, 2024, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court's decision and remanded the case. The Eleventh Circuit held that two factors in the Governor's suspension decision\u2014the abortion statement and the political benefit to the Governor\u2014were protected by the First Amendment, though the district court had considered them unprotected. Therefore, the Eleventh Circuit remanded the case so that the district court could analyze whether the Governor would have made the same suspension decision if none of the protected factors were present. 90 F.4th 1115.\n\nThe Governor subsequently petitioned for rehearing en banc. While the Eleventh Circuit considered whether to grant the petition, the plaintiff's term of office as State Attorney concluded. On January 1, 2025, the Eleventh Circuit vacated its previous opinion, holding that the case was now moot because the court could not provide the plaintiff meaningful relief. The Court rejected the plaintiff's argument that the case fell into an exception for cases \"capable of repetition yet evading review\" because the plaintiff had not shown a likelihood that he would subsequently run for and win another public office that the governor would suspend him from. 125 F.4th 1361.\n\nThe case was subsequently dismissed, and is now closed.",
