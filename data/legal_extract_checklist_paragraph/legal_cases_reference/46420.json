The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 14, 2025, a Venezuelan man filed this petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California. He named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State.\n\nRepresented by the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay, the petitioner challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove him from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review.\u00a0\u00a0The petitioner alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. He sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing him from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Kirk E. Sherriff.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nDistrict Judge Kirk E. Sherriff granted an emergency TRO on April 15, enjoining Defendants from removing the petitioner from the jurisdiction of the court. Judge Sherriff affirmed the TRO following a hearing on April 16 and extended it until May 5. The court scheduled a hearing for May 5.\n\nJudge Sherriff granted the government's motion to dismiss the case on May 27 without prejudice on the grounds that the government detained Y.G.H. in the Northern District of Texas on April 14 when he filed this case and, therefore, the California court lacked jurisdiction.\u00a0 The petitioner's counsel requested that the court dismiss the case rather than ordering Transfer of the Petition to the appropriate court.\n\nSee W.M.M.

    "target": "This case is one of several lawsuits challenging the Trump administration\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act [AEA]\u00a0 to detain and deport noncitizens without due process. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 14, 2025, a Venezuelan man filed this petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California. He named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State.\n\nRepresented by the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay, the petitioner challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove him from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review.\u00a0\u00a0The petitioner alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. He sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing him from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Kirk E. Sherriff.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nDistrict Judge Kirk E. Sherriff granted an emergency TRO on April 15, enjoining Defendants from removing the petitioner from the jurisdiction of the court. Judge Sherriff affirmed the TRO following a hearing on April 16 and extended it until May 5. The court scheduled a hearing for May 5.\n\nJudge Sherriff granted the government's motion to dismiss the case on May 27 without prejudice on the grounds that the government detained Y.G.H. in the Northern District of Texas on April 14 when he filed this case and, therefore, the California court lacked jurisdiction.\u00a0 The petitioner's counsel requested that the court dismiss the case rather than ordering Transfer of the Petition to the appropriate court.\n\nSee W.M.M. (A.R.P.) v. Trump [../../../../cases/46411] for related litigation in the Northern District of Texas.",

    "target": "This case is one of several lawsuits challenging the Trump administration\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act [AEA]\u00a0 to detain and deport noncitizens without due process. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 14, 2025, a Venezuelan man filed this petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California. He named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State.\n\nRepresented by the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay, the petitioner challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove him from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review.\u00a0\u00a0The petitioner alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. He sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing him from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Kirk E. Sherriff.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nDistrict Judge Kirk E. Sherriff granted an emergency TRO on April 15, enjoining Defendants from removing the petitioner from the jurisdiction of the court. Judge Sherriff affirmed the TRO following a hearing on April 16 and extended it until May 5. The court scheduled a hearing for May 5.\n\nJudge Sherriff granted the government's motion to dismiss the case on May 27 without prejudice on the grounds that the government detained Y.G.H. in the Northern District of Texas on April 14 when he filed this case and, therefore, the California court lacked jurisdiction.\u00a0 The petitioner's counsel requested that the court dismiss the case rather than ordering Transfer of the Petition to the appropriate court.\n\nSee W.M.M.
