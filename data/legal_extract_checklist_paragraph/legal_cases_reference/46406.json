    "target": "This is a case about race-based discouragement in mortgage lending in violation of federal consumer protection and anti-discrimination laws. \u00a0On July 15, 2020, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. The Bureau sued Townstone Financial, Inc., a Chicago-based mortgage lender, and its owner, Barry Sturner, under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), its implementing regulation (Regulation B), and the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA). Represented by public counsel, the Bureau sought injunctive relief, civil monetary penalties, and programmatic reforms. It claimed that Townstone violated ECOA and Regulation B by making a series of public statements\u2014primarily on a radio show and podcast\u2014that discouraged Black prospective applicants, especially those living in majority-Black neighborhoods in the Chicago area, from applying for mortgage loans between at least 2014 through 2017. Judge Franklin U. Valderrama was assigned to the case.\n\nOn October 23, 2020, Townstone filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the ECOA did not extend protections to prospective applicants and therefore did not prohibit discouraging potential borrowers from applying. They also contended that the Bureau failed to state a valid legal claim and raised First Amendment defenses, claiming their statements were protected speech. The motion sought dismissal of the case before any discovery or further proceedings.\n\nThen, on November 6, 2020, the Bureau filed an amended complaint that expanded the allegations by adding claims under the Consumer Financial Protection Act for unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts, included allegations of fraudulent transfer to shield assets from enforcement, and provided additional details about Townstone\u2019s pattern of making public statements that discouraged Black prospective mortgage applicants, reinforcing the claims of violations of federal anti-discrimination laws.\n\nTownstone filed a subsequent motion to dismiss on February 8, 2021. This motion challenged the amended complaint\u2019s legal sufficiency. On February 3, 2023, Judge Valderrama granted the defendants\u2019 subsequent motion to dismiss, holding that ECOA did not apply to \u201cprospective applicants.\u201d The Bureau appealed, and on July 11, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that ECOA and Regulation B did prohibit discouraging prospective applicants. On November 7, 2024, the parties entered a stipulated final judgment and order requiring Townstone to pay a $105,000 civil penalty, cease discriminatory practices, implement compliance and monitoring systems, and provide employee training.\n\nOn March 26, 2025, under the new Trump administration, the CFPB and Townstone jointly moved to vacate the consent judgment under Rule 60(b)(6), citing newly discovered internal CFPB missteps and First Amendment concerns. However, on June 12, 2025, Judge Valderrama denied the motion, emphasizing the importance of finality in judicial decisions. Judge Valderrama stated that to repudiate a consent judgment simply because of changes in political administration undermines the integrity of the judicial process and would set a dangerous precedent. He also expressed concern about reopening settled matters based solely on new policy disagreements. As a result, the consent judgment remains in effect, and the case is considered concluded.",

The Bureau sued Townstone Financial, Inc., a Chicago-based mortgage lender, and its owner, Barry Sturner, under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), its implementing regulation (Regulation B), and the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA). Represented by public counsel, the Bureau sought injunctive relief, civil monetary penalties, and programmatic reforms. It claimed that Townstone violated ECOA and Regulation B by making a series of public statements\u2014primarily on a radio show and podcast\u2014that discouraged Black prospective applicants, especially those living in majority-Black neighborhoods in the Chicago area, from applying for mortgage loans between at least 2014 through 2017.

    "target": "This is a case about race-based discouragement in mortgage lending in violation of federal consumer protection and anti-discrimination laws. \u00a0On July 15, 2020, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. The Bureau sued Townstone Financial, Inc., a Chicago-based mortgage lender, and its owner, Barry Sturner, under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), its implementing regulation (Regulation B), and the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA). Represented by public counsel, the Bureau sought injunctive relief, civil monetary penalties, and programmatic reforms. It claimed that Townstone violated ECOA and Regulation B by making a series of public statements\u2014primarily on a radio show and podcast\u2014that discouraged Black prospective applicants, especially those living in majority-Black neighborhoods in the Chicago area, from applying for mortgage loans between at least 2014 through 2017. Judge Franklin U. Valderrama was assigned to the case.\n\nOn October 23, 2020, Townstone filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the ECOA did not extend protections to prospective applicants and therefore did not prohibit discouraging potential borrowers from applying. They also contended that the Bureau failed to state a valid legal claim and raised First Amendment defenses, claiming their statements were protected speech. The motion sought dismissal of the case before any discovery or further proceedings.\n\nThen, on November 6, 2020, the Bureau filed an amended complaint that expanded the allegations by adding claims under the Consumer Financial Protection Act for unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts, included allegations of fraudulent transfer to shield assets from enforcement, and provided additional details about Townstone\u2019s pattern of making public statements that discouraged Black prospective mortgage applicants, reinforcing the claims of violations of federal anti-discrimination laws.\n\nTownstone filed a subsequent motion to dismiss on February 8, 2021. This motion challenged the amended complaint\u2019s legal sufficiency. On February 3, 2023, Judge Valderrama granted the defendants\u2019 subsequent motion to dismiss, holding that ECOA did not apply to \u201cprospective applicants.\u201d The Bureau appealed, and on July 11, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that ECOA and Regulation B did prohibit discouraging prospective applicants. On November 7, 2024, the parties entered a stipulated final judgment and order requiring Townstone to pay a $105,000 civil penalty, cease discriminatory practices, implement compliance and monitoring systems, and provide employee training.\n\nOn March 26, 2025, under the new Trump administration, the CFPB and Townstone jointly moved to vacate the consent judgment under Rule 60(b)(6), citing newly discovered internal CFPB missteps and First Amendment concerns. However, on June 12, 2025, Judge Valderrama denied the motion, emphasizing the importance of finality in judicial decisions. Judge Valderrama stated that to repudiate a consent judgment simply because of changes in political administration undermines the integrity of the judicial process and would set a dangerous precedent. He also expressed concern about reopening settled matters based solely on new policy disagreements. As a result, the consent judgment remains in effect, and the case is considered concluded.",

    "target": "This is a case about race-based discouragement in mortgage lending in violation of federal consumer protection and anti-discrimination laws. \u00a0On July 15, 2020, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. The Bureau sued Townstone Financial, Inc., a Chicago-based mortgage lender, and its owner, Barry Sturner, under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), its implementing regulation (Regulation B), and the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA). Represented by public counsel, the Bureau sought injunctive relief, civil monetary penalties, and programmatic reforms. It claimed that Townstone violated ECOA and Regulation B by making a series of public statements\u2014primarily on a radio show and podcast\u2014that discouraged Black prospective applicants, especially those living in majority-Black neighborhoods in the Chicago area, from applying for mortgage loans between at least 2014 through 2017. Judge Franklin U. Valderrama was assigned to the case.\n\nOn October 23, 2020, Townstone filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the ECOA did not extend protections to prospective applicants and therefore did not prohibit discouraging potential borrowers from applying. They also contended that the Bureau failed to state a valid legal claim and raised First Amendment defenses, claiming their statements were protected speech. The motion sought dismissal of the case before any discovery or further proceedings.\n\nThen, on November 6, 2020, the Bureau filed an amended complaint that expanded the allegations by adding claims under the Consumer Financial Protection Act for unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts, included allegations of fraudulent transfer to shield assets from enforcement, and provided additional details about Townstone\u2019s pattern of making public statements that discouraged Black prospective mortgage applicants, reinforcing the claims of violations of federal anti-discrimination laws.\n\nTownstone filed a subsequent motion to dismiss on February 8, 2021. This motion challenged the amended complaint\u2019s legal sufficiency. On February 3, 2023, Judge Valderrama granted the defendants\u2019 subsequent motion to dismiss, holding that ECOA did not apply to \u201cprospective applicants.\u201d The Bureau appealed, and on July 11, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that ECOA and Regulation B did prohibit discouraging prospective applicants. On November 7, 2024, the parties entered a stipulated final judgment and order requiring Townstone to pay a $105,000 civil penalty, cease discriminatory practices, implement compliance and monitoring systems, and provide employee training.\n\nOn March 26, 2025, under the new Trump administration, the CFPB and Townstone jointly moved to vacate the consent judgment under Rule 60(b)(6), citing newly discovered internal CFPB missteps and First Amendment concerns. However, on June 12, 2025, Judge Valderrama denied the motion, emphasizing the importance of finality in judicial decisions. Judge Valderrama stated that to repudiate a consent judgment simply because of changes in political administration undermines the integrity of the judicial process and would set a dangerous precedent. He also expressed concern about reopening settled matters based solely on new policy disagreements. As a result, the consent judgment remains in effect, and the case is considered concluded.",
