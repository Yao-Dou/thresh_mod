    "target": "This case is one of several lawsuits challenging the Trump administration\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to detain and deport noncitizens without due process. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38953&ordering=-summary_approved_date]. This case was also certified related to Sanchez Puentes, et al., v. Garite, et al. [../../../../case/46501/]. \u00a0Both cases revolved around the use of the AEA to remove noncitizens in Texas and the resolution of the motions pending in either case could impact the other.\n\nThis petition arises out of the president's peacetime invocation of the AEA. The petitioner is a 33-year-old Venezuelan national detained at the El Paso Processing Center. After coming to the US, the petitioner was granted Temporary Protected Status (TRP) which shields her from detention. On April 9, 2025, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detained the petitioner in Ohio, despite her active TPS.\n\nOn May 10, 2025, the petitioner filed this petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. She also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, a motion to proceed under a pseudonym, and a motion for class certification. The plaintiff named President Donald Trump, the U.S. Attorney General, the Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its Acting Director and other officials, the Department of State and its Secretary, the Department of Defense and its Secretary, and the wardens of several detention centers as Defendants.\n\nThe plaintiff sought to represent a class challenging the federal government's use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to detain and remove Venezuelan noncitizens from the United States without due process. She alleged that the government's actions exceeded it authority under the AEA and violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and Due Process under the Fifth Amendment. The case was assigned to Senior District Judge David Briones.\n\nOn May 13, 2025, Judge Briones issued a class-wide temporary restraining order\u2014prohibiting removal of potential class members and requiring certain advance notice to attorneys\u2014while also setting an expedited briefing schedule on class certification. 2025 WL 1379220.\n\nOn May 16, the court issued two orders: (1) an order for the Respondents to show cause at to why the Petitioner's writ should not be granted; (2) an \"Order Extending the Original Temporary Restraining Order\" until June 10, 2025.\n\nThe petitioner moved for a preliminary injunction on May 21, 2025, to enjoin the respondents from removing the petitioner or members of the certified class from the United States under the AEA. The motion alleged that the petitioners, and the class members, could be removed with no process if preliminary relief were not granted. This could result torture or a life sentence in El Salvador-- a harm the government refused to remedy in the past.\n\nThe next day, the court ordered that the hearing for the preliminary injunction be combined with a trial on the merits. The court also certified a class of \"all noncitizens in custody in the Western District of Texas who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua' and/or its implementation.\" 2025 WL 1479504. The court found that even though there may be questions of fact amongst the class members that may require individualized hearings to resolve, they shared the common claim that the Proclamation is unlawful.\n\nThe court granted the petitioner's class-wide writ of habeas corpus and motion for a preliminary injunction on June 9, 2025. 2025 WL 1622260. While habeas petitions are typically granted individually, the court found that because their claims for relief imply the illegality of their removal under the AEA, their claims fall within the 'core' of the writ of habeas corpus and could be brought through this suit.\n\nFinding that there were no genuine issues of material fact, the court treated the petitioner's motion for a class-wide preliminary injunction as a motion for summary judgment, and thus, issued permanent injunctive relief. Proclamation 10903 was declared unlawful and the respondents were enjoined from removing the members of the certified class from the United States pursuant to Proclamation 10903.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case is one of several lawsuits challenging the Trump administration\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to detain and deport noncitizens without due process. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38953&ordering=-summary_approved_date]. This case was also certified related to Sanchez Puentes, et al., v. Garite, et al. [../../../../case/46501/]. \u00a0Both cases revolved around the use of the AEA to remove noncitizens in Texas and the resolution of the motions pending in either case could impact the other.\n\nThis petition arises out of the president's peacetime invocation of the AEA. The petitioner is a 33-year-old Venezuelan national detained at the El Paso Processing Center. After coming to the US, the petitioner was granted Temporary Protected Status (TRP) which shields her from detention. On April 9, 2025, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detained the petitioner in Ohio, despite her active TPS.\n\nOn May 10, 2025, the petitioner filed this petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. She also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, a motion to proceed under a pseudonym, and a motion for class certification. The plaintiff named President Donald Trump, the U.S. Attorney General, the Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its Acting Director and other officials, the Department of State and its Secretary, the Department of Defense and its Secretary, and the wardens of several detention centers as Defendants.\n\nThe plaintiff sought to represent a class challenging the federal government's use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to detain and remove Venezuelan noncitizens from the United States without due process. She alleged that the government's actions exceeded it authority under the AEA and violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and Due Process under the Fifth Amendment. The case was assigned to Senior District Judge David Briones.\n\nOn May 13, 2025, Judge Briones issued a class-wide temporary restraining order\u2014prohibiting removal of potential class members and requiring certain advance notice to attorneys\u2014while also setting an expedited briefing schedule on class certification. 2025 WL 1379220.\n\nOn May 16, the court issued two orders: (1) an order for the Respondents to show cause at to why the Petitioner's writ should not be granted; (2) an \"Order Extending the Original Temporary Restraining Order\" until June 10, 2025.\n\nThe petitioner moved for a preliminary injunction on May 21, 2025, to enjoin the respondents from removing the petitioner or members of the certified class from the United States under the AEA. The motion alleged that the petitioners, and the class members, could be removed with no process if preliminary relief were not granted. This could result torture or a life sentence in El Salvador-- a harm the government refused to remedy in the past.\n\nThe next day, the court ordered that the hearing for the preliminary injunction be combined with a trial on the merits. The court also certified a class of \"all noncitizens in custody in the Western District of Texas who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua' and/or its implementation.\" 2025 WL 1479504. The court found that even though there may be questions of fact amongst the class members that may require individualized hearings to resolve, they shared the common claim that the Proclamation is unlawful.\n\nThe court granted the petitioner's class-wide writ of habeas corpus and motion for a preliminary injunction on June 9, 2025. 2025 WL 1622260. While habeas petitions are typically granted individually, the court found that because their claims for relief imply the illegality of their removal under the AEA, their claims fall within the 'core' of the writ of habeas corpus and could be brought through this suit.\n\nFinding that there were no genuine issues of material fact, the court treated the petitioner's motion for a class-wide preliminary injunction as a motion for summary judgment, and thus, issued permanent injunctive relief. Proclamation 10903 was declared unlawful and the respondents were enjoined from removing the members of the certified class from the United States pursuant to Proclamation 10903.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38953&ordering=-summary_approved_date]. This case was also certified related to Sanchez Puentes, et al., v. Garite, et al. [../../../../case/46501/]. \u00a0Both cases revolved around the use of the AEA to remove noncitizens in Texas and the resolution of the motions pending in either case could impact the other.\n\nThis petition arises out of the president's peacetime invocation of the AEA. The petitioner is a 33-year-old Venezuelan national detained at the El Paso Processing Center. After coming to the US, the petitioner was granted Temporary Protected Status (TRP) which shields her from detention. On April 9, 2025, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detained the petitioner in Ohio, despite her active TPS.\n\nOn May 10, 2025, the petitioner filed this petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. She also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, a motion to proceed under a pseudonym, and a motion for class certification. The plaintiff named President Donald Trump, the U.S. Attorney General, the Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its Acting Director and other officials, the Department of State and its Secretary, the Department of Defense and its Secretary, and the wardens of several detention centers as Defendants.\n\nThe plaintiff sought to represent a class challenging the federal government's use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to detain and remove Venezuelan noncitizens from the United States without due process. She alleged that the government's actions exceeded it authority under the AEA and violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and Due Process under the Fifth Amendment. The case was assigned to Senior District Judge David Briones.\n\nOn May 13, 2025, Judge Briones issued a class-wide temporary restraining order\u2014prohibiting removal of potential class members and requiring certain advance notice to attorneys\u2014while also setting an expedited briefing schedule on class certification. 2025 WL 1379220.\n\nOn May 16, the court issued two orders: (1) an order for the Respondents to show cause at to why the Petitioner's writ should not be granted; (2) an \"Order Extending the Original Temporary Restraining Order\" until June 10, 2025.\n\nThe petitioner moved for a preliminary injunction on May 21, 2025, to enjoin the respondents from removing the petitioner or members of the certified class from the United States under the AEA. The motion alleged that the petitioners, and the class members, could be removed with no process if preliminary relief were not granted. This could result torture or a life sentence in El Salvador-- a harm the government refused to remedy in the past.\n\nThe next day, the court ordered that the hearing for the preliminary injunction be combined with a trial on the merits. The court also certified a class of \"all noncitizens in custody in the Western District of Texas who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua' and/or its implementation.\" 2025 WL 1479504. The court found that even though there may be questions of fact amongst the class members that may require individualized hearings to resolve, they shared the common claim that the Proclamation is unlawful.\n\nThe court granted the petitioner's class-wide writ of habeas corpus and motion for a preliminary injunction on June 9, 2025. 2025 WL 1622260. While habeas petitions are typically granted individually, the court found that because their claims for relief imply the illegality of their removal under the AEA, their claims fall within the 'core' of the writ of habeas corpus and could be brought through this suit.\n\nFinding that there were no genuine issues of material fact, the court treated the petitioner's motion for a class-wide preliminary injunction as a motion for summary judgment, and thus, issued permanent injunctive relief. Proclamation 10903 was declared unlawful and the respondents were enjoined from removing the members of the certified class from the United States pursuant to Proclamation 10903.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

The plaintiff named President Donald Trump, the U.S. Attorney General, the Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its Acting Director and other officials, the Department of State and its Secretary, the Department of Defense and its Secretary, and the wardens of several detention centers as Defendants.\n\nThe plaintiff sought to represent a class challenging the federal government's use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to detain and remove Venezuelan noncitizens from the United States without due process. She alleged that the government's actions exceeded it authority under the AEA and violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and Due Process under the Fifth Amendment. The case was assigned to Senior District Judge David Briones.\n\nOn May 13, 2025, Judge Briones issued a class-wide temporary restraining order\u2014prohibiting removal of potential class members and requiring certain advance notice to attorneys\u2014while also setting an expedited briefing schedule on class certification. 2025 WL 1379220.\n\nOn May 16, the court issued two orders: (1) an order for the Respondents to show cause at to why the Petitioner's writ should not be granted; (2) an \"Order Extending the Original Temporary Restraining Order\" until June 10, 2025.\n\nThe petitioner moved for a preliminary injunction on May 21, 2025, to enjoin the respondents from removing the petitioner or members of the certified class from the United States under the AEA. The motion alleged that the petitioners, and the class members, could be removed with no process if preliminary relief were not granted. This could result torture or a life sentence in El Salvador-- a harm the government refused to remedy in the past.\n\nThe next day, the court ordered that the hearing for the preliminary injunction be combined with a trial on the merits. The court also certified a class of \"all noncitizens in custody in the Western District of Texas who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua' and/or its implementation.\" 2025 WL 1479504. The court found that even though there may be questions of fact amongst the class members that may require individualized hearings to resolve, they shared the common claim that the Proclamation is unlawful.\n\nThe court granted the petitioner's class-wide writ of habeas corpus and motion for a preliminary injunction on June 9, 2025. 2025 WL 1622260. While habeas petitions are typically granted individually, the court found that because their claims for relief imply the illegality of their removal under the AEA, their claims fall within the 'core' of the writ of habeas corpus and could be brought through this suit.\n\nFinding that there were no genuine issues of material fact, the court treated the petitioner's motion for a class-wide preliminary injunction as a motion for summary judgment, and thus, issued permanent injunctive relief. Proclamation 10903 was declared unlawful and the respondents were enjoined from removing the members of the certified class from the United States pursuant to Proclamation 10903.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case is one of several lawsuits challenging the Trump administration\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to detain and deport noncitizens without due process. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38953&ordering=-summary_approved_date]. This case was also certified related to Sanchez Puentes, et al., v. Garite, et al. [../../../../case/46501/]. \u00a0Both cases revolved around the use of the AEA to remove noncitizens in Texas and the resolution of the motions pending in either case could impact the other.\n\nThis petition arises out of the president's peacetime invocation of the AEA. The petitioner is a 33-year-old Venezuelan national detained at the El Paso Processing Center. After coming to the US, the petitioner was granted Temporary Protected Status (TRP) which shields her from detention. On April 9, 2025, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detained the petitioner in Ohio, despite her active TPS.\n\nOn May 10, 2025, the petitioner filed this petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. She also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, a motion to proceed under a pseudonym, and a motion for class certification. The plaintiff named President Donald Trump, the U.S. Attorney General, the Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its Acting Director and other officials, the Department of State and its Secretary, the Department of Defense and its Secretary, and the wardens of several detention centers as Defendants.\n\nThe plaintiff sought to represent a class challenging the federal government's use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to detain and remove Venezuelan noncitizens from the United States without due process. She alleged that the government's actions exceeded it authority under the AEA and violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and Due Process under the Fifth Amendment. The case was assigned to Senior District Judge David Briones.\n\nOn May 13, 2025, Judge Briones issued a class-wide temporary restraining order\u2014prohibiting removal of potential class members and requiring certain advance notice to attorneys\u2014while also setting an expedited briefing schedule on class certification. 2025 WL 1379220.\n\nOn May 16, the court issued two orders: (1) an order for the Respondents to show cause at to why the Petitioner's writ should not be granted; (2) an \"Order Extending the Original Temporary Restraining Order\" until June 10, 2025.\n\nThe petitioner moved for a preliminary injunction on May 21, 2025, to enjoin the respondents from removing the petitioner or members of the certified class from the United States under the AEA. The motion alleged that the petitioners, and the class members, could be removed with no process if preliminary relief were not granted. This could result torture or a life sentence in El Salvador-- a harm the government refused to remedy in the past.\n\nThe next day, the court ordered that the hearing for the preliminary injunction be combined with a trial on the merits. The court also certified a class of \"all noncitizens in custody in the Western District of Texas who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua' and/or its implementation.\" 2025 WL 1479504. The court found that even though there may be questions of fact amongst the class members that may require individualized hearings to resolve, they shared the common claim that the Proclamation is unlawful.\n\nThe court granted the petitioner's class-wide writ of habeas corpus and motion for a preliminary injunction on June 9, 2025. 2025 WL 1622260. While habeas petitions are typically granted individually, the court found that because their claims for relief imply the illegality of their removal under the AEA, their claims fall within the 'core' of the writ of habeas corpus and could be brought through this suit.\n\nFinding that there were no genuine issues of material fact, the court treated the petitioner's motion for a class-wide preliminary injunction as a motion for summary judgment, and thus, issued permanent injunctive relief. Proclamation 10903 was declared unlawful and the respondents were enjoined from removing the members of the certified class from the United States pursuant to Proclamation 10903.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",
