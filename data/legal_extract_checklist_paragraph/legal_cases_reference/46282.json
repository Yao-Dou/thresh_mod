On March 24, 2025, Rana S. Coleman, proceeding pro se and purporting to act \u201con behalf of\u201d RScoleman & Associates Staffing LLC, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiff alleged that the executive orders, and a February 14, 2025 guidance letter from the Department of Education enforcing them, violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and caused harm to the plaintiff\u2019s DEIA-focused work supporting Black students and HBCUs.\n\nThe plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt enforcement of the executive orders and the guidance letter. Plaintiff alleged that the actions of the federal government would strip away funding and partnerships for race-conscious educational initiatives and chill advocacy for Black communities.\n\nOn the same day the complaint was filed, the court denied plaintiff\u2019s application to proceed in forma pauperis and issued an order to show cause. The court found that RScoleman LLC\u2014not Coleman individually\u2014was the real party in interest, and that corporations and LLCs cannot appear pro se or qualify for in forma pauperis status. The court ordered Coleman to retain licensed counsel within 30 days or face dismissal.\n\nOn June 23, plaintiff requested a stay of proceedings to continue seeking representation, but the court denied that request. Finding that no attorney had appeared and the filing fee remained unpaid, the court dismissed the case without prejudice on June 25.\n\nThe case is closed.",
