    "target": "This case is about New York\u2019s deadline for independent nominating petitions, which must be filed 23 weeks before the general election. Byron W. Brown was the incumbent Mayor of Buffalo but lost the June 22, 2021 Democratic primary election. Two months later, Brown filed an independent nominating petition seeking to appear on the general election ballot. That petition was rejected because it was filed after the deadline of May 25, 2021.\n\nOn August 30, 2021, three registered voters who supported Byron W. Brown\u2019s independent candidacy for Mayor filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York. They sued the Erie County Board of Elections under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought 1) a declaratory judgment that New York\u2019s deadline for independent candidate petitions as applied to Byron W. Brown for Mayor of Buffalo violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; 2) an order enjoining the Board from enforcing the deadline and from failing to place him on the 2021 general-election ballot; and 3) attorneys\u2019 fees. The case was assigned to District Judge John Sinatra, Jr.\n\nOn September 3, 2021, the district court issued a preliminary injunction ordering the Erie County Board of Elections to put Byron W. Brown on the 2021 ballot as an independent candidate for Mayor of Buffalo. The defendants appealed that injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which issued an order on September 16, 2021 staying of the preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs did not appeal the Second Circuit\u2019s order, and Byron W. Brown did not appear on the general election ballot. However, on November 2, 2021, Brown won reelection after campaigning as a write-in candidate.\n\nBrown\u2019s election victory rendered the appeal of the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction moot, so the Second Circuit sent the case back to the district court to hear the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional challenge to the independent nominating petition deadline. On April 20, 2022, the district court referred the case to U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Roemer.\n\nOn July 11, 2023, the district court ruled that despite the 2021 election having already taken place and Brown winning reelection, the constitutional challenge was not moot because the underlying dispute was capable of repetition, yet evading review. However, the court dismissed the complaint because it found that the independent petition deadline did not violate the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights.\n\nOn August 19, 2024, the Second Circuit vacated the district court\u2019s July 11, 2023 order. The Second Circuit sent the case back to the district court with instructions to dismiss the case as moot. The Second Circuit expressed no view on the constitutionality of the challenged filing deadline. On August 20, 2024, the district court dismissed the case as moot.\n\nOn June 2, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear the case.",

    "target": "This case is about New York\u2019s deadline for independent nominating petitions, which must be filed 23 weeks before the general election. Byron W. Brown was the incumbent Mayor of Buffalo but lost the June 22, 2021 Democratic primary election. Two months later, Brown filed an independent nominating petition seeking to appear on the general election ballot. That petition was rejected because it was filed after the deadline of May 25, 2021.\n\nOn August 30, 2021, three registered voters who supported Byron W. Brown\u2019s independent candidacy for Mayor filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York. They sued the Erie County Board of Elections under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought 1) a declaratory judgment that New York\u2019s deadline for independent candidate petitions as applied to Byron W. Brown for Mayor of Buffalo violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; 2) an order enjoining the Board from enforcing the deadline and from failing to place him on the 2021 general-election ballot; and 3) attorneys\u2019 fees. The case was assigned to District Judge John Sinatra, Jr.\n\nOn September 3, 2021, the district court issued a preliminary injunction ordering the Erie County Board of Elections to put Byron W. Brown on the 2021 ballot as an independent candidate for Mayor of Buffalo. The defendants appealed that injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which issued an order on September 16, 2021 staying of the preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs did not appeal the Second Circuit\u2019s order, and Byron W. Brown did not appear on the general election ballot. However, on November 2, 2021, Brown won reelection after campaigning as a write-in candidate.\n\nBrown\u2019s election victory rendered the appeal of the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction moot, so the Second Circuit sent the case back to the district court to hear the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional challenge to the independent nominating petition deadline. On April 20, 2022, the district court referred the case to U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Roemer.\n\nOn July 11, 2023, the district court ruled that despite the 2021 election having already taken place and Brown winning reelection, the constitutional challenge was not moot because the underlying dispute was capable of repetition, yet evading review. However, the court dismissed the complaint because it found that the independent petition deadline did not violate the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights.\n\nOn August 19, 2024, the Second Circuit vacated the district court\u2019s July 11, 2023 order. The Second Circuit sent the case back to the district court with instructions to dismiss the case as moot. The Second Circuit expressed no view on the constitutionality of the challenged filing deadline. On August 20, 2024, the district court dismissed the case as moot.\n\nOn June 2, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear the case.",

    "target": "This case is about New York\u2019s deadline for independent nominating petitions, which must be filed 23 weeks before the general election. Byron W. Brown was the incumbent Mayor of Buffalo but lost the June 22, 2021 Democratic primary election. Two months later, Brown filed an independent nominating petition seeking to appear on the general election ballot. That petition was rejected because it was filed after the deadline of May 25, 2021.\n\nOn August 30, 2021, three registered voters who supported Byron W. Brown\u2019s independent candidacy for Mayor filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York. They sued the Erie County Board of Elections under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought 1) a declaratory judgment that New York\u2019s deadline for independent candidate petitions as applied to Byron W. Brown for Mayor of Buffalo violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; 2) an order enjoining the Board from enforcing the deadline and from failing to place him on the 2021 general-election ballot; and 3) attorneys\u2019 fees. The case was assigned to District Judge John Sinatra, Jr.\n\nOn September 3, 2021, the district court issued a preliminary injunction ordering the Erie County Board of Elections to put Byron W. Brown on the 2021 ballot as an independent candidate for Mayor of Buffalo. The defendants appealed that injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which issued an order on September 16, 2021 staying of the preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs did not appeal the Second Circuit\u2019s order, and Byron W. Brown did not appear on the general election ballot. However, on November 2, 2021, Brown won reelection after campaigning as a write-in candidate.\n\nBrown\u2019s election victory rendered the appeal of the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction moot, so the Second Circuit sent the case back to the district court to hear the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional challenge to the independent nominating petition deadline. On April 20, 2022, the district court referred the case to U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Roemer.\n\nOn July 11, 2023, the district court ruled that despite the 2021 election having already taken place and Brown winning reelection, the constitutional challenge was not moot because the underlying dispute was capable of repetition, yet evading review. However, the court dismissed the complaint because it found that the independent petition deadline did not violate the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights.\n\nOn August 19, 2024, the Second Circuit vacated the district court\u2019s July 11, 2023 order. The Second Circuit sent the case back to the district court with instructions to dismiss the case as moot. The Second Circuit expressed no view on the constitutionality of the challenged filing deadline. On August 20, 2024, the district court dismissed the case as moot.\n\nOn June 2, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear the case.",
