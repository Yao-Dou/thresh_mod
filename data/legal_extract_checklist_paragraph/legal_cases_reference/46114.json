    "target": "This case challenged the Trump Administration\u2019s shutdown of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). On February 8, 2025, the Acting Director of the CFPB instructed the agency\u2019s employees to \u201cstand down\u201d from performing any work and notified the Federal Reserve that the CFPB would be requesting $0 for the upcoming quarter. Elon Musk was also involved, posting \u201cCFPB RIP\u201d on social media one day before the announcement. This shutdown occurred within the broader context of the Trump Administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle several federal agencies and shrink others.\n\nOn February 12, 2025, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, along with the Economic Action Maryland Fund, initiated legal action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland by filing a lawsuit against the CFPB and its Acting Director for violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs, represented by the Democracy Forward Foundation, sought a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctions, and declaratory relief, with the goal of preventing the defunding of the CFPB. They argued that the government\u2019s actions were arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and exceeded statutory authority. The plaintiffs also contended that they would be irreparably harmed by the Administration\u2019s unlawful action, as they heavily rely on the CFPB. The case was assigned to Judge Matthew J. Maddox on February 14, 2025.\n\nIn their motion for a temporary restraining order (filed on February 12, 2025), the plaintiffs asked the Court to enjoin the Administration from defunding the CFPB. They argued that such actions violated the APA and would cause imminent injury. With the loss of consumer protection benefits and resources provided by the CFPB, the plaintiffs claimed that they would need to divert resources from other essential functions. The next day, a joint motion was filed to convert the request for a temporary restraining order into a motion for a preliminary injunction, along with a proposed briefing schedule. The motion stipulated that the CFPB would refrain from taking any actions to defund the agency until the motion expires on February 28, 2025.\n\nOn February 19, 2025, 22 states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. The states argued that the absence of statutorily mandated services provided by the CFPB would harm consumers\u2019 wellbeing as well as states\u2019 own efforts to enforce consumer protection laws.\n\nOn March 14, 2025, the Court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for preliminary relief. Judge Maddox stated that because, \u201cPlaintiffs fail to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims, their motion for the extraordinary remedy of preliminary injunctive relief must be denied.\u201d He further explained:\n\nFor the Court to intervene and entangle itself in the Bureau\u2019s administrative processes before the agency has made any final decision about the disposition of its operating and reserve funds\u2014and without clear indication that an unlawful and injurious decision will be made imminently\u2014would exceed the bounds of the Court\u2019s proper role and jurisdiction. It would be especially improper for the Court to risk exceeding its limited role on a preliminary basis.\n\nOn May 29, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of the case. Given the defendants' representation that \"there is no mechanism by which Defendant Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can transfer away money from, or otherwise relinquish control over the money in, the Bureau Fund,\" except for \"internally transferring reserve funds to use for operations,\" the plaintiffs said they wished to dismiss their case. \"If Defendants later transfer Bureau funds in contradiction of their repeated representations about their lawful authorities, abilities, and intent, Plaintiffs will undertake further actions as appropriate.\"\n\nThis case is closed.",

    "target": "This case challenged the Trump Administration\u2019s shutdown of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). On February 8, 2025, the Acting Director of the CFPB instructed the agency\u2019s employees to \u201cstand down\u201d from performing any work and notified the Federal Reserve that the CFPB would be requesting $0 for the upcoming quarter. Elon Musk was also involved, posting \u201cCFPB RIP\u201d on social media one day before the announcement. This shutdown occurred within the broader context of the Trump Administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle several federal agencies and shrink others.\n\nOn February 12, 2025, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, along with the Economic Action Maryland Fund, initiated legal action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland by filing a lawsuit against the CFPB and its Acting Director for violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs, represented by the Democracy Forward Foundation, sought a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctions, and declaratory relief, with the goal of preventing the defunding of the CFPB. They argued that the government\u2019s actions were arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and exceeded statutory authority. The plaintiffs also contended that they would be irreparably harmed by the Administration\u2019s unlawful action, as they heavily rely on the CFPB. The case was assigned to Judge Matthew J. Maddox on February 14, 2025.\n\nIn their motion for a temporary restraining order (filed on February 12, 2025), the plaintiffs asked the Court to enjoin the Administration from defunding the CFPB. They argued that such actions violated the APA and would cause imminent injury. With the loss of consumer protection benefits and resources provided by the CFPB, the plaintiffs claimed that they would need to divert resources from other essential functions. The next day, a joint motion was filed to convert the request for a temporary restraining order into a motion for a preliminary injunction, along with a proposed briefing schedule. The motion stipulated that the CFPB would refrain from taking any actions to defund the agency until the motion expires on February 28, 2025.\n\nOn February 19, 2025, 22 states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. The states argued that the absence of statutorily mandated services provided by the CFPB would harm consumers\u2019 wellbeing as well as states\u2019 own efforts to enforce consumer protection laws.\n\nOn March 14, 2025, the Court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for preliminary relief. Judge Maddox stated that because, \u201cPlaintiffs fail to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims, their motion for the extraordinary remedy of preliminary injunctive relief must be denied.\u201d He further explained:\n\nFor the Court to intervene and entangle itself in the Bureau\u2019s administrative processes before the agency has made any final decision about the disposition of its operating and reserve funds\u2014and without clear indication that an unlawful and injurious decision will be made imminently\u2014would exceed the bounds of the Court\u2019s proper role and jurisdiction. It would be especially improper for the Court to risk exceeding its limited role on a preliminary basis.\n\nOn May 29, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of the case. Given the defendants' representation that \"there is no mechanism by which Defendant Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can transfer away money from, or otherwise relinquish control over the money in, the Bureau Fund,\" except for \"internally transferring reserve funds to use for operations,\" the plaintiffs said they wished to dismiss their case. \"If Defendants later transfer Bureau funds in contradiction of their repeated representations about their lawful authorities, abilities, and intent, Plaintiffs will undertake further actions as appropriate.\"\n\nThis case is closed.",

The plaintiffs also contended that they would be irreparably harmed by the Administration\u2019s unlawful action, as they heavily rely on the CFPB. The case was assigned to Judge Matthew J. Maddox on February 14, 2025.\n\nIn their motion for a temporary restraining order (filed on February 12, 2025), the plaintiffs asked the Court to enjoin the Administration from defunding the CFPB. They argued that such actions violated the APA and would cause imminent injury. With the loss of consumer protection benefits and resources provided by the CFPB, the plaintiffs claimed that they would need to divert resources from other essential functions. The next day, a joint motion was filed to convert the request for a temporary restraining order into a motion for a preliminary injunction, along with a proposed briefing schedule. The motion stipulated that the CFPB would refrain from taking any actions to defund the agency until the motion expires on February 28, 2025.\n\nOn February 19, 2025, 22 states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. The states argued that the absence of statutorily mandated services provided by the CFPB would harm consumers\u2019 wellbeing as well as states\u2019 own efforts to enforce consumer protection laws.\n\nOn March 14, 2025, the Court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for preliminary relief. Judge Maddox stated that because, \u201cPlaintiffs fail to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims, their motion for the extraordinary remedy of preliminary injunctive relief must be denied.\u201d He further explained:\n\nFor the Court to intervene and entangle itself in the Bureau\u2019s administrative processes before the agency has made any final decision about the disposition of its operating and reserve funds\u2014and without clear indication that an unlawful and injurious decision will be made imminently\u2014would exceed the bounds of the Court\u2019s proper role and jurisdiction. It would be especially improper for the Court to risk exceeding its limited role on a preliminary basis.\n\nOn May 29, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of the case. Given the defendants' representation that \"there is no mechanism by which Defendant Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can transfer away money from, or otherwise relinquish control over the money in, the Bureau Fund,\" except for \"internally transferring reserve funds to use for operations,\" the plaintiffs said they wished to dismiss their case. \"If Defendants later transfer Bureau funds in contradiction of their repeated representations about their lawful authorities, abilities, and intent, Plaintiffs will undertake further actions as appropriate.\"\n\nThis case is closed.",
