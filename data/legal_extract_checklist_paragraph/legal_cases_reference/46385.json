    "target": "This lawsuit challenges congressional action taken against Northwestern University.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, the plaintiffs \u2013 two clinical professors of law at Northwestern University \u2013 filed suit against three government defendants \u2013 the \u00a0U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Workforce, and two U.S. House Member in their capacity as Committee Chair and Subcommittee Chair respectively \u2013 and three nominal defendants \u2013 Northwestern University, the President of Northwestern University, and the Chair of the Board of Trustees of Northwestern University.\n\nThe Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law runs the Bluhm Legal Clinic, a legal services organization which houses twenty different clinical programs and provide pro bono legal services to clients on a range of matters, from appellate advocacy, housing and tenant issues, and environmental advocacy. Plaintiffs set forth the following facts in their complaint: Plaintiffs are clinical professors of law at the Community Justice and Civil Rights Clinic and the Center on Negotiation, Mediation, and Restorative Justice, respectively.\n\nPlaintiffs noted that in 2024, amidst student protests over the war in Gaza, Northwestern University reached an agreement with student protestors, wherein students agreed to remove their protest encampment in exchange for the promise of the continuation of peaceful protests. In the same year, the Committee on Education and Workforce, a standing committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, made multiple requests for information from Northwestern relating to the protests.\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 complaint further alleged that after the Trump administration took office in January 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14188 on January 29, which directed executive agencies to identify authorities under their jurisdictions to combat antisemitism. Consistent with that Executive Order, the Department of Justice established a joint task force to combat \u201cantisemitic acts of terrorism and civil rights violations,\u201d and opened investigations into Northwestern and four other universities. The House Committee demanded more information from Northwestern in March 2025: Noting that Northwestern had provided free legal representation to the organizers of an anti-Israeli highway blockage protest, the Committee demanded several categories of documents relating to clinical work done at Northwestern Law, including all written policies and guidance relating to legal clinics; a detailed budget for the Bluhm Legal Clinic; and all hiring and performance reviews for one of the plaintiffs.\n\nPlaintiffs challenged the demands, by making the following claims: (1) Defendants\u2019 actions violated plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights to advocate on behalf of clients, and constituted viewpoint-based discrimination with no legitimate legislative purpose. (2) Defendants violated plaintiffs\u2019 due process rights under the Fifth Amendment, by failing to provide adequate process before interfering with plaintiffs\u2019 right to represent their clients. (3) Defendants interfered with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to counsel requirement, a constitutional claim which plaintiffs had prudential, third-party standing to bring on behalf of their clients. (4) Defendants violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as the investigation reflected a \u201cbare desire to harm Plaintiffs\u201d for their political affiliations.\n\nPlaintiffs requested declaratory and injunctive relief, to declare the demand for information unconstitutional and enjoin the nominal defendants from producing any documents responsive to the Committee request.\n\nThe case was assigned to the Honorable Elaine E. Bucklo.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for an emergency temporary restraining order. As the Committee on Education and Workforce had issued a demand for information from Northwestern University, plaintiffs requested that the court issue an order to stay the Committee\u2019s demand and prevent the university from complying by April 10. Plaintiffs argued that the investigation was part of an ideological campaign by the White House to target non-ideologically aligned universities and institutions, and that the stated goal of combating antisemitism was merely pretextual for this politically-motivated attack. Plaintiffs further alleged that the clinical programs at Northwestern University would be harmed as a result of the Committee\u2019s inquiry. Plaintiffs therefore urged the court to issue a temporary restraining order.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, plaintiff\u2019s counsel submitted a declaration, noting that the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an emergency temporary restraining order had asked the court to act by April 10, but that did not allow time to provide notice to the Committee. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel submitted in their declaration that they provided notice to counsel for the Committee and to Northwestern University.\n\nThe committee then withdrew its request.\u00a0 After the hearing on the request for a temporary restraining order, on April 10, 2025, the court ruled that there was no longer a need for emergency relief, and denied the motion without prejudice.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

Plaintiffs argued that the investigation was part of an ideological campaign by the White House to target non-ideologically aligned universities and institutions, and that the stated goal of combating antisemitism was merely pretextual for this politically-motivated attack. Plaintiffs further alleged that the clinical programs at Northwestern University would be harmed as a result of the Committee\u2019s inquiry. Plaintiffs therefore urged the court to issue a temporary restraining order.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, plaintiff\u2019s counsel submitted a declaration, noting that the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an emergency temporary restraining order had asked the court to act by April 10, but that did not allow time to provide notice to the Committee. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel submitted in their declaration that they provided notice to counsel for the Committee and to Northwestern University.\n\nThe committee then withdrew its request.\u00a0 After the hearing on the request for a temporary restraining order, on April 10, 2025, the court ruled that there was no longer a need for emergency relief, and denied the motion without prejudice.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

(3) Defendants interfered with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to counsel requirement, a constitutional claim which plaintiffs had prudential, third-party standing to bring on behalf of their clients. (4) Defendants violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as the investigation reflected a \u201cbare desire to harm Plaintiffs\u201d for their political affiliations.\n\nPlaintiffs requested declaratory and injunctive relief, to declare the demand for information unconstitutional and enjoin the nominal defendants from producing any documents responsive to the Committee request.\n\nThe case was assigned to the Honorable Elaine E.

(2) Defendants violated plaintiffs\u2019 due process rights under the Fifth Amendment, by failing to provide adequate process before interfering with plaintiffs\u2019 right to represent their clients. (3) Defendants interfered with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to counsel requirement, a constitutional claim which plaintiffs had prudential, third-party standing to bring on behalf of their clients. (4) Defendants violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as the investigation reflected a \u201cbare desire to harm Plaintiffs\u201d for their political affiliations.\n\nPlaintiffs requested declaratory and injunctive relief, to declare the demand for information unconstitutional and enjoin the nominal defendants from producing any documents responsive to the Committee request.\n\nThe case was assigned to the Honorable Elaine E. Bucklo.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for an emergency temporary restraining order. As the Committee on Education and Workforce had issued a demand for information from Northwestern University, plaintiffs requested that the court issue an order to stay the Committee\u2019s demand and prevent the university from complying by April 10. Plaintiffs argued that the investigation was part of an ideological campaign by the White House to target non-ideologically aligned universities and institutions, and that the stated goal of combating antisemitism was merely pretextual for this politically-motivated attack. Plaintiffs further alleged that the clinical programs at Northwestern University would be harmed as a result of the Committee\u2019s inquiry. Plaintiffs therefore urged the court to issue a temporary restraining order.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, plaintiff\u2019s counsel submitted a declaration, noting that the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an emergency temporary restraining order had asked the court to act by April 10, but that did not allow time to provide notice to the Committee. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel submitted in their declaration that they provided notice to counsel for the Committee and to Northwestern University.\n\nThe committee then withdrew its request.\u00a0 After the hearing on the request for a temporary restraining order, on April 10, 2025, the court ruled that there was no longer a need for emergency relief, and denied the motion without prejudice.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",
