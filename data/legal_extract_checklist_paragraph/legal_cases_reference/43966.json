    "target": "On October 15, 2018, individuals without secure housing filed this class-action lawsuit suing the city of Grants Pass, Oregon (the \u201cCity\u201d) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Represented by the Oregon Law Center, the plaintiffs challenged the City\u2019s enforcement of Grants Pass\u2019s anti-sleeping ordinance, anti-camping ordinance, park exclusion ordinance, and criminal trespass laws stemming from violations of these ordinances as unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S Constitution. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief prohibiting the City from enforcing the ordinances and criminal trespass laws until the class members had the opportunity to obtain shelter. The plaintiffs also sought declaratory relief as well as costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had contacted the City on September 10, 2018, to demand relief, but the parties were unable to resolve the dispute outside of court.\n\nThe case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Mark D. Clarke. Both parties consented to jurisdiction by a magistrate judge for the entirety of the case. On January 2, 2019, the City amended its ordinance, removing \u201csleeping\u201d from the definition of camping in an attempt to comply with a previous case, Martin v. Boise, which held that an ordinance punishing people for sleeping outside was unconstitutional when there was nowhere else for them to go. In amending its ordinance, the City meant to clarify that the act of \u201csleeping\u201d no longer automatically constituted illegal \u201ccamping,\u201d permitting those without shelter to sleep or rest in the City\u2019s parks.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 28, 2019, to add information about two additional plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on March 8, 2019, adding an additional individual to the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys.\n\nOn March 13, 2019, the plaintiffs moved to certify the class. After a hearing, Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification on August 7, 2019. 2019 WL 3717800. The court defined the class as: \"All involuntarily homeless individuals living in Grants Pass, Oregon, including homeless individuals who sometimes sleep outside city limits to avoid harassment and punishment by Defendant as addressed in this lawsuit.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs then filed their third amended complaint on November 13, 2019 to add an additional challenge to park exclusions under the Due Process Clause. On January 17, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and requested an oral argument. The defendant responded with a joint motion for summary judgment on February 28, 2020.\n\nOn July 22, 2020, Magistrate Judge Clarke denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and he granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the procedural due process claim because the park exclusions would go into effect immediately and were not stayed for appeal, leaving a person excluded from a park subject to arrest for reentry as soon as they received the exclusion notice. The court concluded that the deficient appeal procedures were unconstitutional and violated the procedural protections of due process. However, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their equal protection claim because the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the ordinances were selectively enforced and motivated by a discriminatory purpose. Likewise, summary judgment was denied on the plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process claim because they failed to convince the court that they had a liberty interest to sleep or camp in a public place and had not shown that the city engaged in \u201cconscience shocking behavior.\u201d 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nThe court also found that the ordinances violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment because they punished people for sleeping or resting outside with a blanket when they had no other place to go due to the City\u2019s lack of adequate shelter. The ordinances also violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment because the plaintiffs were being punished for trying to live, and likely could not afford to pay the fines, resulting in additional fees and punishments that made it even more difficult for them to find housing. 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nOn August 26, 2020, Judge Clarke issued an injunction enjoining the enforcement of three city ordinances against the plaintiff class. The City could not enforce the park exclusion ordinance, which allowed police officers to issue an order barring a person from all City park properties if the individual had been issued two or more citations violating regulations relating to city parks, or one citation violating state laws while on city park property. Unless it gave at least a 24-hour warning, the City also could not enforce the camping ordinances, which prohibited setting up or remaining on public property. Finally, the City could not enforce the criminal trespassing ordinance in city parks during nighttime hours.\n\nThat same day, the city of Grants Pass appealed the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment and its permanent injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35752). The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision on September 28, 2022, affirmed that the city\u2019s \u201canti-camping\u201d ordinance prohibiting individuals from using bedding supplies violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. The case was remanded with direction to the district court to narrow its injunction to only enjoin enforcement of ordinances against unhoused individuals who take necessary measures to keep themselves warm and safe when there is no shelter available. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit vacated the grant of summary judgment on the procedural due process claim and remanded with instructions to dismiss the claim as moot because the City amended the ordinance so it was no longer unconstitutional. 50 F.4th 787.\n\nIn the meantime, the plaintiffs filed a motion for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees on September 9, 2020. The parties thereafter, by October 5, 2020, reached an agreement for the plaintiffs to receive $300,000 with interest for their costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. 2020 WL 6060925. Three days later, on October 8, the City appealed to the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35881).\n\nThe City filed a petition for en banc review with the Ninth Circuit on November 14, 2022.\n\nOn July 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit amended the opinion it issued on September 28, 2022. It amended the order to deny the petition for rehearing en banc, reasoning that Grants Pass provided exceptionally limited protection and was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. The court further stated that future petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc would not be entertained in this case.\n\nIn response to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s denial for a rehearing en banc, the City filed a petition for writ of certiorari on August 22, 2023, requesting the Supreme Court to rule on whether laws regulating camping on public property constituted cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. 2023 WL 5530379.\n\nOn January 16, 2024, the Supreme Court granted certiorari. On June 28, 2024, the Supreme Court issued its decision, ruling 6-3 to reverse and remand. 2024 WL 3208072. \u00a0The majority\u2019s decision, written by Justice Gorsuch and joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, reasoned that the Eighth Amendment focuses on the \u201cmethod or kind of punishment\u201d that may be imposed after conviction, and not on whether the government may criminalize particular behavior, and therefore could not support the relief sought. The Court further held that the punishments imposed by Grants Pass under the challenged statute were not cruel and unusual. The majority opinion further rejected the argument that laws against camping criminalized the \u201cstatus\u201d of homelessness, reasoning that the challenged law applied to anyone who undertook the act of camping, rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 argument \u201ccamping, for people without other housing options, was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d and thus could not be criminalized. The Court therefore reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n\nIn a concurrence, Justice Thomas noted his opinion that the 1962 case rendering \u201cstatus crimes\u201d unconstitutional was wrongly decided, and rejected the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments clause governed civil penalties because they could later become criminal offenses. The dissenting opinion, authored by Justice Sotomayor and joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, urged that the Eighth Amendment prohibits criminalizing the status of homelessness by making it a crime to sleep outside when a person has no other place to sleep. The dissent further noted that the Court had not decided whether the ordinance violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause, Due Process, or state law.\n\nOn September 23, 2024, this matter was remanded to the district court for the limited purpose of approving a settlement agreement between the two parties. The parties informed the court that the matter was settled, and the case was dismissed without prejudice.",

    "target": "On October 15, 2018, individuals without secure housing filed this class-action lawsuit suing the city of Grants Pass, Oregon (the \u201cCity\u201d) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Represented by the Oregon Law Center, the plaintiffs challenged the City\u2019s enforcement of Grants Pass\u2019s anti-sleeping ordinance, anti-camping ordinance, park exclusion ordinance, and criminal trespass laws stemming from violations of these ordinances as unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S Constitution. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief prohibiting the City from enforcing the ordinances and criminal trespass laws until the class members had the opportunity to obtain shelter. The plaintiffs also sought declaratory relief as well as costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had contacted the City on September 10, 2018, to demand relief, but the parties were unable to resolve the dispute outside of court.\n\nThe case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Mark D. Clarke. Both parties consented to jurisdiction by a magistrate judge for the entirety of the case. On January 2, 2019, the City amended its ordinance, removing \u201csleeping\u201d from the definition of camping in an attempt to comply with a previous case, Martin v. Boise, which held that an ordinance punishing people for sleeping outside was unconstitutional when there was nowhere else for them to go. In amending its ordinance, the City meant to clarify that the act of \u201csleeping\u201d no longer automatically constituted illegal \u201ccamping,\u201d permitting those without shelter to sleep or rest in the City\u2019s parks.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 28, 2019, to add information about two additional plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on March 8, 2019, adding an additional individual to the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys.\n\nOn March 13, 2019, the plaintiffs moved to certify the class. After a hearing, Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification on August 7, 2019. 2019 WL 3717800. The court defined the class as: \"All involuntarily homeless individuals living in Grants Pass, Oregon, including homeless individuals who sometimes sleep outside city limits to avoid harassment and punishment by Defendant as addressed in this lawsuit.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs then filed their third amended complaint on November 13, 2019 to add an additional challenge to park exclusions under the Due Process Clause. On January 17, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and requested an oral argument. The defendant responded with a joint motion for summary judgment on February 28, 2020.\n\nOn July 22, 2020, Magistrate Judge Clarke denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and he granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the procedural due process claim because the park exclusions would go into effect immediately and were not stayed for appeal, leaving a person excluded from a park subject to arrest for reentry as soon as they received the exclusion notice. The court concluded that the deficient appeal procedures were unconstitutional and violated the procedural protections of due process. However, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their equal protection claim because the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the ordinances were selectively enforced and motivated by a discriminatory purpose. Likewise, summary judgment was denied on the plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process claim because they failed to convince the court that they had a liberty interest to sleep or camp in a public place and had not shown that the city engaged in \u201cconscience shocking behavior.\u201d 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nThe court also found that the ordinances violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment because they punished people for sleeping or resting outside with a blanket when they had no other place to go due to the City\u2019s lack of adequate shelter. The ordinances also violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment because the plaintiffs were being punished for trying to live, and likely could not afford to pay the fines, resulting in additional fees and punishments that made it even more difficult for them to find housing. 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nOn August 26, 2020, Judge Clarke issued an injunction enjoining the enforcement of three city ordinances against the plaintiff class. The City could not enforce the park exclusion ordinance, which allowed police officers to issue an order barring a person from all City park properties if the individual had been issued two or more citations violating regulations relating to city parks, or one citation violating state laws while on city park property. Unless it gave at least a 24-hour warning, the City also could not enforce the camping ordinances, which prohibited setting up or remaining on public property. Finally, the City could not enforce the criminal trespassing ordinance in city parks during nighttime hours.\n\nThat same day, the city of Grants Pass appealed the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment and its permanent injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35752). The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision on September 28, 2022, affirmed that the city\u2019s \u201canti-camping\u201d ordinance prohibiting individuals from using bedding supplies violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. The case was remanded with direction to the district court to narrow its injunction to only enjoin enforcement of ordinances against unhoused individuals who take necessary measures to keep themselves warm and safe when there is no shelter available. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit vacated the grant of summary judgment on the procedural due process claim and remanded with instructions to dismiss the claim as moot because the City amended the ordinance so it was no longer unconstitutional. 50 F.4th 787.\n\nIn the meantime, the plaintiffs filed a motion for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees on September 9, 2020. The parties thereafter, by October 5, 2020, reached an agreement for the plaintiffs to receive $300,000 with interest for their costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. 2020 WL 6060925. Three days later, on October 8, the City appealed to the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35881).\n\nThe City filed a petition for en banc review with the Ninth Circuit on November 14, 2022.\n\nOn July 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit amended the opinion it issued on September 28, 2022. It amended the order to deny the petition for rehearing en banc, reasoning that Grants Pass provided exceptionally limited protection and was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. The court further stated that future petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc would not be entertained in this case.\n\nIn response to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s denial for a rehearing en banc, the City filed a petition for writ of certiorari on August 22, 2023, requesting the Supreme Court to rule on whether laws regulating camping on public property constituted cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. 2023 WL 5530379.\n\nOn January 16, 2024, the Supreme Court granted certiorari. On June 28, 2024, the Supreme Court issued its decision, ruling 6-3 to reverse and remand. 2024 WL 3208072. \u00a0The majority\u2019s decision, written by Justice Gorsuch and joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, reasoned that the Eighth Amendment focuses on the \u201cmethod or kind of punishment\u201d that may be imposed after conviction, and not on whether the government may criminalize particular behavior, and therefore could not support the relief sought. The Court further held that the punishments imposed by Grants Pass under the challenged statute were not cruel and unusual. The majority opinion further rejected the argument that laws against camping criminalized the \u201cstatus\u201d of homelessness, reasoning that the challenged law applied to anyone who undertook the act of camping, rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 argument \u201ccamping, for people without other housing options, was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d and thus could not be criminalized. The Court therefore reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n\nIn a concurrence, Justice Thomas noted his opinion that the 1962 case rendering \u201cstatus crimes\u201d unconstitutional was wrongly decided, and rejected the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments clause governed civil penalties because they could later become criminal offenses. The dissenting opinion, authored by Justice Sotomayor and joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, urged that the Eighth Amendment prohibits criminalizing the status of homelessness by making it a crime to sleep outside when a person has no other place to sleep. The dissent further noted that the Court had not decided whether the ordinance violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause, Due Process, or state law.\n\nOn September 23, 2024, this matter was remanded to the district court for the limited purpose of approving a settlement agreement between the two parties. The parties informed the court that the matter was settled, and the case was dismissed without prejudice.",

Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the procedural due process claim because the park exclusions would go into effect immediately and were not stayed for appeal, leaving a person excluded from a park subject to arrest for reentry as soon as they received the exclusion notice. The court concluded that the deficient appeal procedures were unconstitutional and violated the procedural protections of due process. However, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their equal protection claim because the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the ordinances were selectively enforced and motivated by a discriminatory purpose. Likewise, summary judgment was denied on the plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process claim because they failed to convince the court that they had a liberty interest to sleep or camp in a public place and had not shown that the city engaged in \u201cconscience shocking behavior.\u201d 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nThe court also found that the ordinances violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment because they punished people for sleeping or resting outside with a blanket when they had no other place to go due to the City\u2019s lack of adequate shelter. The ordinances also violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment because the plaintiffs were being punished for trying to live, and likely could not afford to pay the fines, resulting in additional fees and punishments that made it even more difficult for them to find housing. 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nOn August 26, 2020, Judge Clarke issued an injunction enjoining the enforcement of three city ordinances against the plaintiff class. The City could not enforce the park exclusion ordinance, which allowed police officers to issue an order barring a person from all City park properties if the individual had been issued two or more citations violating regulations relating to city parks, or one citation violating state laws while on city park property. Unless it gave at least a 24-hour warning, the City also could not enforce the camping ordinances, which prohibited setting up or remaining on public property. Finally, the City could not enforce the criminal trespassing ordinance in city parks during nighttime hours.\n\nThat same day, the city of Grants Pass appealed the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment and its permanent injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35752). The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision on September 28, 2022, affirmed that the city\u2019s \u201canti-camping\u201d ordinance prohibiting individuals from using bedding supplies violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. The case was remanded with direction to the district court to narrow its injunction to only enjoin enforcement of ordinances against unhoused individuals who take necessary measures to keep themselves warm and safe when there is no shelter available. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit vacated the grant of summary judgment on the procedural due process claim and remanded with instructions to dismiss the claim as moot because the City amended the ordinance so it was no longer unconstitutional. 50 F.4th 787.\n\nIn the meantime, the plaintiffs filed a motion for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees on September 9, 2020. The parties thereafter, by October 5, 2020, reached an agreement for the plaintiffs to receive $300,000 with interest for their costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. 2020 WL 6060925. Three days later, on October 8, the City appealed to the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35881).\n\nThe City filed a petition for en banc review with the Ninth Circuit on November 14, 2022.\n\nOn July 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit amended the opinion it issued on September 28, 2022. It amended the order to deny the petition for rehearing en banc, reasoning that Grants Pass provided exceptionally limited protection and was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. The court further stated that future petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc would not be entertained in this case.\n\nIn response to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s denial for a rehearing en banc, the City filed a petition for writ of certiorari on August 22, 2023, requesting the Supreme Court to rule on whether laws regulating camping on public property constituted cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. 2023 WL 5530379.\n\nOn January 16, 2024, the Supreme Court granted certiorari. On June 28, 2024, the Supreme Court issued its decision, ruling 6-3 to reverse and remand. 2024 WL 3208072. \u00a0The majority\u2019s decision, written by Justice Gorsuch and joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, reasoned that the Eighth Amendment focuses on the \u201cmethod or kind of punishment\u201d that may be imposed after conviction, and not on whether the government may criminalize particular behavior, and therefore could not support the relief sought. The Court further held that the punishments imposed by Grants Pass under the challenged statute were not cruel and unusual. The majority opinion further rejected the argument that laws against camping criminalized the \u201cstatus\u201d of homelessness, reasoning that the challenged law applied to anyone who undertook the act of camping, rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 argument \u201ccamping, for people without other housing options, was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d and thus could not be criminalized. The Court therefore reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n\nIn a concurrence, Justice Thomas noted his opinion that the 1962 case rendering \u201cstatus crimes\u201d unconstitutional was wrongly decided, and rejected the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments clause governed civil penalties because they could later become criminal offenses. The dissenting opinion, authored by Justice Sotomayor and joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, urged that the Eighth Amendment prohibits criminalizing the status of homelessness by making it a crime to sleep outside when a person has no other place to sleep. The dissent further noted that the Court had not decided whether the ordinance violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause, Due Process, or state law.\n\nOn September 23, 2024, this matter was remanded to the district court for the limited purpose of approving a settlement agreement between the two parties. The parties informed the court that the matter was settled, and the case was dismissed without prejudice.",

Represented by the Oregon Law Center, the plaintiffs challenged the City\u2019s enforcement of Grants Pass\u2019s anti-sleeping ordinance, anti-camping ordinance, park exclusion ordinance, and criminal trespass laws stemming from violations of these ordinances as unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S Constitution.

Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the procedural due process claim because the park exclusions would go into effect immediately and were not stayed for appeal, leaving a person excluded from a park subject to arrest for reentry as soon as they received the exclusion notice. The court concluded that the deficient appeal procedures were unconstitutional and violated the procedural protections of due process. However, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their equal protection claim because the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the ordinances were selectively enforced and motivated by a discriminatory purpose. Likewise, summary judgment was denied on the plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process claim because they failed to convince the court that they had a liberty interest to sleep or camp in a public place and had not shown that the city engaged in \u201cconscience shocking behavior.\u201d 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nThe court also found that the ordinances violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment because they punished people for sleeping or resting outside with a blanket when they had no other place to go due to the City\u2019s lack of adequate shelter. The ordinances also violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment because the plaintiffs were being punished for trying to live, and likely could not afford to pay the fines, resulting in additional fees and punishments that made it even more difficult for them to find housing. 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nOn August 26, 2020, Judge Clarke issued an injunction enjoining the enforcement of three city ordinances against the plaintiff class. The City could not enforce the park exclusion ordinance, which allowed police officers to issue an order barring a person from all City park properties if the individual had been issued two or more citations violating regulations relating to city parks, or one citation violating state laws while on city park property. Unless it gave at least a 24-hour warning, the City also could not enforce the camping ordinances, which prohibited setting up or remaining on public property. Finally, the City could not enforce the criminal trespassing ordinance in city parks during nighttime hours.\n\nThat same day, the city of Grants Pass appealed the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment and its permanent injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35752). The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision on September 28, 2022, affirmed that the city\u2019s \u201canti-camping\u201d ordinance prohibiting individuals from using bedding supplies violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. The case was remanded with direction to the district court to narrow its injunction to only enjoin enforcement of ordinances against unhoused individuals who take necessary measures to keep themselves warm and safe when there is no shelter available. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit vacated the grant of summary judgment on the procedural due process claim and remanded with instructions to dismiss the claim as moot because the City amended the ordinance so it was no longer unconstitutional. 50 F.4th 787.\n\nIn the meantime, the plaintiffs filed a motion for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees on September 9, 2020. The parties thereafter, by October 5, 2020, reached an agreement for the plaintiffs to receive $300,000 with interest for their costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. 2020 WL 6060925. Three days later, on October 8, the City appealed to the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35881).\n\nThe City filed a petition for en banc review with the Ninth Circuit on November 14, 2022.\n\nOn July 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit amended the opinion it issued on September 28, 2022. It amended the order to deny the petition for rehearing en banc, reasoning that Grants Pass provided exceptionally limited protection and was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. The court further stated that future petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc would not be entertained in this case.\n\nIn response to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s denial for a rehearing en banc, the City filed a petition for writ of certiorari on August 22, 2023, requesting the Supreme Court to rule on whether laws regulating camping on public property constituted cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. 2023 WL 5530379.\n\nOn January 16, 2024, the Supreme Court granted certiorari. On June 28, 2024, the Supreme Court issued its decision, ruling 6-3 to reverse and remand. 2024 WL 3208072. \u00a0The majority\u2019s decision, written by Justice Gorsuch and joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, reasoned that the Eighth Amendment focuses on the \u201cmethod or kind of punishment\u201d that may be imposed after conviction, and not on whether the government may criminalize particular behavior, and therefore could not support the relief sought. The Court further held that the punishments imposed by Grants Pass under the challenged statute were not cruel and unusual. The majority opinion further rejected the argument that laws against camping criminalized the \u201cstatus\u201d of homelessness, reasoning that the challenged law applied to anyone who undertook the act of camping, rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 argument \u201ccamping, for people without other housing options, was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d and thus could not be criminalized. The Court therefore reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n\nIn a concurrence, Justice Thomas noted his opinion that the 1962 case rendering \u201cstatus crimes\u201d unconstitutional was wrongly decided, and rejected the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments clause governed civil penalties because they could later become criminal offenses. The dissenting opinion, authored by Justice Sotomayor and joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, urged that the Eighth Amendment prohibits criminalizing the status of homelessness by making it a crime to sleep outside when a person has no other place to sleep. The dissent further noted that the Court had not decided whether the ordinance violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause, Due Process, or state law.\n\nOn September 23, 2024, this matter was remanded to the district court for the limited purpose of approving a settlement agreement between the two parties. The parties informed the court that the matter was settled, and the case was dismissed without prejudice.",

Represented by the Oregon Law Center, the plaintiffs challenged the City\u2019s enforcement of Grants Pass\u2019s anti-sleeping ordinance, anti-camping ordinance, park exclusion ordinance, and criminal trespass laws stemming from violations of these ordinances as unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S Constitution. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief prohibiting the City from enforcing the ordinances and criminal trespass laws until the class members had the opportunity to obtain shelter. The plaintiffs also sought declaratory relief as well as costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had contacted the City on September 10, 2018, to demand relief, but the parties were unable to resolve the dispute outside of court.\n\nThe case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Mark D. Clarke. Both parties consented to jurisdiction by a magistrate judge for the entirety of the case. On January 2, 2019, the City amended its ordinance, removing \u201csleeping\u201d from the definition of camping in an attempt to comply with a previous case, Martin v. Boise, which held that an ordinance punishing people for sleeping outside was unconstitutional when there was nowhere else for them to go. In amending its ordinance, the City meant to clarify that the act of \u201csleeping\u201d no longer automatically constituted illegal \u201ccamping,\u201d permitting those without shelter to sleep or rest in the City\u2019s parks.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 28, 2019, to add information about two additional plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on March 8, 2019, adding an additional individual to the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys.\n\nOn March 13, 2019, the plaintiffs moved to certify the class. After a hearing, Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification on August 7, 2019. 2019 WL 3717800. The court defined the class as: \"All involuntarily homeless individuals living in Grants Pass, Oregon, including homeless individuals who sometimes sleep outside city limits to avoid harassment and punishment by Defendant as addressed in this lawsuit.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs then filed their third amended complaint on November 13, 2019 to add an additional challenge to park exclusions under the Due Process Clause. On January 17, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and requested an oral argument. The defendant responded with a joint motion for summary judgment on February 28, 2020.\n\nOn July 22, 2020, Magistrate Judge Clarke denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and he granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment.

On January 17, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and requested an oral argument. The defendant responded with a joint motion for summary judgment on February 28, 2020.\n\nOn July 22, 2020, Magistrate Judge Clarke denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and he granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the procedural due process claim because the park exclusions would go into effect immediately and were not stayed for appeal, leaving a person excluded from a park subject to arrest for reentry as soon as they received the exclusion notice. The court concluded that the deficient appeal procedures were unconstitutional and violated the procedural protections of due process. However, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their equal protection claim because the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the ordinances were selectively enforced and motivated by a discriminatory purpose. Likewise, summary judgment was denied on the plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process claim because they failed to convince the court that they had a liberty interest to sleep or camp in a public place and had not shown that the city engaged in \u201cconscience shocking behavior.\u201d 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nThe court also found that the ordinances violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment because they punished people for sleeping or resting outside with a blanket when they had no other place to go due to the City\u2019s lack of adequate shelter. The ordinances also violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment because the plaintiffs were being punished for trying to live, and likely could not afford to pay the fines, resulting in additional fees and punishments that made it even more difficult for them to find housing. 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nOn August 26, 2020, Judge Clarke issued an injunction enjoining the enforcement of three city ordinances against the plaintiff class. The City could not enforce the park exclusion ordinance, which allowed police officers to issue an order barring a person from all City park properties if the individual had been issued two or more citations violating regulations relating to city parks, or one citation violating state laws while on city park property. Unless it gave at least a 24-hour warning, the City also could not enforce the camping ordinances, which prohibited setting up or remaining on public property. Finally, the City could not enforce the criminal trespassing ordinance in city parks during nighttime hours.\n\nThat same day, the city of Grants Pass appealed the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment and its permanent injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35752). The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision on September 28, 2022, affirmed that the city\u2019s \u201canti-camping\u201d ordinance prohibiting individuals from using bedding supplies violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. The case was remanded with direction to the district court to narrow its injunction to only enjoin enforcement of ordinances against unhoused individuals who take necessary measures to keep themselves warm and safe when there is no shelter available. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit vacated the grant of summary judgment on the procedural due process claim and remanded with instructions to dismiss the claim as moot because the City amended the ordinance so it was no longer unconstitutional. 50 F.4th 787.\n\nIn the meantime, the plaintiffs filed a motion for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees on September 9, 2020. The parties thereafter, by October 5, 2020, reached an agreement for the plaintiffs to receive $300,000 with interest for their costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. 2020 WL 6060925. Three days later, on October 8, the City appealed to the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35881).\n\nThe City filed a petition for en banc review with the Ninth Circuit on November 14, 2022.\n\nOn July 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit amended the opinion it issued on September 28, 2022. It amended the order to deny the petition for rehearing en banc, reasoning that Grants Pass provided exceptionally limited protection and was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. The court further stated that future petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc would not be entertained in this case.\n\nIn response to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s denial for a rehearing en banc, the City filed a petition for writ of certiorari on August 22, 2023, requesting the Supreme Court to rule on whether laws regulating camping on public property constituted cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. 2023 WL 5530379.\n\nOn January 16, 2024, the Supreme Court granted certiorari. On June 28, 2024, the Supreme Court issued its decision, ruling 6-3 to reverse and remand. 2024 WL 3208072. \u00a0The majority\u2019s decision, written by Justice Gorsuch and joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, reasoned that the Eighth Amendment focuses on the \u201cmethod or kind of punishment\u201d that may be imposed after conviction, and not on whether the government may criminalize particular behavior, and therefore could not support the relief sought. The Court further held that the punishments imposed by Grants Pass under the challenged statute were not cruel and unusual. The majority opinion further rejected the argument that laws against camping criminalized the \u201cstatus\u201d of homelessness, reasoning that the challenged law applied to anyone who undertook the act of camping, rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 argument \u201ccamping, for people without other housing options, was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d and thus could not be criminalized. The Court therefore reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n\nIn a concurrence, Justice Thomas noted his opinion that the 1962 case rendering \u201cstatus crimes\u201d unconstitutional was wrongly decided, and rejected the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments clause governed civil penalties because they could later become criminal offenses. The dissenting opinion, authored by Justice Sotomayor and joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, urged that the Eighth Amendment prohibits criminalizing the status of homelessness by making it a crime to sleep outside when a person has no other place to sleep. The dissent further noted that the Court had not decided whether the ordinance violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause, Due Process, or state law.\n\nOn September 23, 2024, this matter was remanded to the district court for the limited purpose of approving a settlement agreement between the two parties. The parties informed the court that the matter was settled, and the case was dismissed without prejudice.",

    "target": "On October 15, 2018, individuals without secure housing filed this class-action lawsuit suing the city of Grants Pass, Oregon (the \u201cCity\u201d) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Represented by the Oregon Law Center, the plaintiffs challenged the City\u2019s enforcement of Grants Pass\u2019s anti-sleeping ordinance, anti-camping ordinance, park exclusion ordinance, and criminal trespass laws stemming from violations of these ordinances as unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S Constitution. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief prohibiting the City from enforcing the ordinances and criminal trespass laws until the class members had the opportunity to obtain shelter. The plaintiffs also sought declaratory relief as well as costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had contacted the City on September 10, 2018, to demand relief, but the parties were unable to resolve the dispute outside of court.\n\nThe case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Mark D. Clarke. Both parties consented to jurisdiction by a magistrate judge for the entirety of the case. On January 2, 2019, the City amended its ordinance, removing \u201csleeping\u201d from the definition of camping in an attempt to comply with a previous case, Martin v. Boise, which held that an ordinance punishing people for sleeping outside was unconstitutional when there was nowhere else for them to go. In amending its ordinance, the City meant to clarify that the act of \u201csleeping\u201d no longer automatically constituted illegal \u201ccamping,\u201d permitting those without shelter to sleep or rest in the City\u2019s parks.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 28, 2019, to add information about two additional plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on March 8, 2019, adding an additional individual to the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys.\n\nOn March 13, 2019, the plaintiffs moved to certify the class. After a hearing, Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification on August 7, 2019. 2019 WL 3717800. The court defined the class as: \"All involuntarily homeless individuals living in Grants Pass, Oregon, including homeless individuals who sometimes sleep outside city limits to avoid harassment and punishment by Defendant as addressed in this lawsuit.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs then filed their third amended complaint on November 13, 2019 to add an additional challenge to park exclusions under the Due Process Clause. On January 17, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and requested an oral argument. The defendant responded with a joint motion for summary judgment on February 28, 2020.\n\nOn July 22, 2020, Magistrate Judge Clarke denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and he granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the procedural due process claim because the park exclusions would go into effect immediately and were not stayed for appeal, leaving a person excluded from a park subject to arrest for reentry as soon as they received the exclusion notice. The court concluded that the deficient appeal procedures were unconstitutional and violated the procedural protections of due process. However, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their equal protection claim because the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the ordinances were selectively enforced and motivated by a discriminatory purpose. Likewise, summary judgment was denied on the plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process claim because they failed to convince the court that they had a liberty interest to sleep or camp in a public place and had not shown that the city engaged in \u201cconscience shocking behavior.\u201d 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nThe court also found that the ordinances violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment because they punished people for sleeping or resting outside with a blanket when they had no other place to go due to the City\u2019s lack of adequate shelter. The ordinances also violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment because the plaintiffs were being punished for trying to live, and likely could not afford to pay the fines, resulting in additional fees and punishments that made it even more difficult for them to find housing. 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nOn August 26, 2020, Judge Clarke issued an injunction enjoining the enforcement of three city ordinances against the plaintiff class. The City could not enforce the park exclusion ordinance, which allowed police officers to issue an order barring a person from all City park properties if the individual had been issued two or more citations violating regulations relating to city parks, or one citation violating state laws while on city park property. Unless it gave at least a 24-hour warning, the City also could not enforce the camping ordinances, which prohibited setting up or remaining on public property. Finally, the City could not enforce the criminal trespassing ordinance in city parks during nighttime hours.\n\nThat same day, the city of Grants Pass appealed the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment and its permanent injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35752). The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision on September 28, 2022, affirmed that the city\u2019s \u201canti-camping\u201d ordinance prohibiting individuals from using bedding supplies violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. The case was remanded with direction to the district court to narrow its injunction to only enjoin enforcement of ordinances against unhoused individuals who take necessary measures to keep themselves warm and safe when there is no shelter available. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit vacated the grant of summary judgment on the procedural due process claim and remanded with instructions to dismiss the claim as moot because the City amended the ordinance so it was no longer unconstitutional. 50 F.4th 787.\n\nIn the meantime, the plaintiffs filed a motion for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees on September 9, 2020. The parties thereafter, by October 5, 2020, reached an agreement for the plaintiffs to receive $300,000 with interest for their costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. 2020 WL 6060925. Three days later, on October 8, the City appealed to the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35881).\n\nThe City filed a petition for en banc review with the Ninth Circuit on November 14, 2022.\n\nOn July 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit amended the opinion it issued on September 28, 2022. It amended the order to deny the petition for rehearing en banc, reasoning that Grants Pass provided exceptionally limited protection and was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. The court further stated that future petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc would not be entertained in this case.\n\nIn response to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s denial for a rehearing en banc, the City filed a petition for writ of certiorari on August 22, 2023, requesting the Supreme Court to rule on whether laws regulating camping on public property constituted cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. 2023 WL 5530379.\n\nOn January 16, 2024, the Supreme Court granted certiorari. On June 28, 2024, the Supreme Court issued its decision, ruling 6-3 to reverse and remand. 2024 WL 3208072. \u00a0The majority\u2019s decision, written by Justice Gorsuch and joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, reasoned that the Eighth Amendment focuses on the \u201cmethod or kind of punishment\u201d that may be imposed after conviction, and not on whether the government may criminalize particular behavior, and therefore could not support the relief sought. The Court further held that the punishments imposed by Grants Pass under the challenged statute were not cruel and unusual. The majority opinion further rejected the argument that laws against camping criminalized the \u201cstatus\u201d of homelessness, reasoning that the challenged law applied to anyone who undertook the act of camping, rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 argument \u201ccamping, for people without other housing options, was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d and thus could not be criminalized. The Court therefore reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n\nIn a concurrence, Justice Thomas noted his opinion that the 1962 case rendering \u201cstatus crimes\u201d unconstitutional was wrongly decided, and rejected the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments clause governed civil penalties because they could later become criminal offenses. The dissenting opinion, authored by Justice Sotomayor and joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, urged that the Eighth Amendment prohibits criminalizing the status of homelessness by making it a crime to sleep outside when a person has no other place to sleep. The dissent further noted that the Court had not decided whether the ordinance violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause, Due Process, or state law.\n\nOn September 23, 2024, this matter was remanded to the district court for the limited purpose of approving a settlement agreement between the two parties. The parties informed the court that the matter was settled, and the case was dismissed without prejudice.",

    "target": "On October 15, 2018, individuals without secure housing filed this class-action lawsuit suing the city of Grants Pass, Oregon (the \u201cCity\u201d) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Represented by the Oregon Law Center, the plaintiffs challenged the City\u2019s enforcement of Grants Pass\u2019s anti-sleeping ordinance, anti-camping ordinance, park exclusion ordinance, and criminal trespass laws stemming from violations of these ordinances as unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S Constitution. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief prohibiting the City from enforcing the ordinances and criminal trespass laws until the class members had the opportunity to obtain shelter. The plaintiffs also sought declaratory relief as well as costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had contacted the City on September 10, 2018, to demand relief, but the parties were unable to resolve the dispute outside of court.\n\nThe case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Mark D. Clarke. Both parties consented to jurisdiction by a magistrate judge for the entirety of the case. On January 2, 2019, the City amended its ordinance, removing \u201csleeping\u201d from the definition of camping in an attempt to comply with a previous case, Martin v. Boise, which held that an ordinance punishing people for sleeping outside was unconstitutional when there was nowhere else for them to go. In amending its ordinance, the City meant to clarify that the act of \u201csleeping\u201d no longer automatically constituted illegal \u201ccamping,\u201d permitting those without shelter to sleep or rest in the City\u2019s parks.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 28, 2019, to add information about two additional plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on March 8, 2019, adding an additional individual to the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys.\n\nOn March 13, 2019, the plaintiffs moved to certify the class. After a hearing, Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification on August 7, 2019. 2019 WL 3717800. The court defined the class as: \"All involuntarily homeless individuals living in Grants Pass, Oregon, including homeless individuals who sometimes sleep outside city limits to avoid harassment and punishment by Defendant as addressed in this lawsuit.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs then filed their third amended complaint on November 13, 2019 to add an additional challenge to park exclusions under the Due Process Clause. On January 17, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and requested an oral argument. The defendant responded with a joint motion for summary judgment on February 28, 2020.\n\nOn July 22, 2020, Magistrate Judge Clarke denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and he granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the procedural due process claim because the park exclusions would go into effect immediately and were not stayed for appeal, leaving a person excluded from a park subject to arrest for reentry as soon as they received the exclusion notice. The court concluded that the deficient appeal procedures were unconstitutional and violated the procedural protections of due process. However, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their equal protection claim because the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the ordinances were selectively enforced and motivated by a discriminatory purpose. Likewise, summary judgment was denied on the plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process claim because they failed to convince the court that they had a liberty interest to sleep or camp in a public place and had not shown that the city engaged in \u201cconscience shocking behavior.\u201d 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nThe court also found that the ordinances violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment because they punished people for sleeping or resting outside with a blanket when they had no other place to go due to the City\u2019s lack of adequate shelter. The ordinances also violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment because the plaintiffs were being punished for trying to live, and likely could not afford to pay the fines, resulting in additional fees and punishments that made it even more difficult for them to find housing. 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nOn August 26, 2020, Judge Clarke issued an injunction enjoining the enforcement of three city ordinances against the plaintiff class. The City could not enforce the park exclusion ordinance, which allowed police officers to issue an order barring a person from all City park properties if the individual had been issued two or more citations violating regulations relating to city parks, or one citation violating state laws while on city park property. Unless it gave at least a 24-hour warning, the City also could not enforce the camping ordinances, which prohibited setting up or remaining on public property. Finally, the City could not enforce the criminal trespassing ordinance in city parks during nighttime hours.\n\nThat same day, the city of Grants Pass appealed the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment and its permanent injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35752). The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision on September 28, 2022, affirmed that the city\u2019s \u201canti-camping\u201d ordinance prohibiting individuals from using bedding supplies violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. The case was remanded with direction to the district court to narrow its injunction to only enjoin enforcement of ordinances against unhoused individuals who take necessary measures to keep themselves warm and safe when there is no shelter available. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit vacated the grant of summary judgment on the procedural due process claim and remanded with instructions to dismiss the claim as moot because the City amended the ordinance so it was no longer unconstitutional. 50 F.4th 787.\n\nIn the meantime, the plaintiffs filed a motion for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees on September 9, 2020. The parties thereafter, by October 5, 2020, reached an agreement for the plaintiffs to receive $300,000 with interest for their costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. 2020 WL 6060925. Three days later, on October 8, the City appealed to the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35881).\n\nThe City filed a petition for en banc review with the Ninth Circuit on November 14, 2022.\n\nOn July 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit amended the opinion it issued on September 28, 2022. It amended the order to deny the petition for rehearing en banc, reasoning that Grants Pass provided exceptionally limited protection and was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. The court further stated that future petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc would not be entertained in this case.\n\nIn response to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s denial for a rehearing en banc, the City filed a petition for writ of certiorari on August 22, 2023, requesting the Supreme Court to rule on whether laws regulating camping on public property constituted cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. 2023 WL 5530379.\n\nOn January 16, 2024, the Supreme Court granted certiorari. On June 28, 2024, the Supreme Court issued its decision, ruling 6-3 to reverse and remand. 2024 WL 3208072. \u00a0The majority\u2019s decision, written by Justice Gorsuch and joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, reasoned that the Eighth Amendment focuses on the \u201cmethod or kind of punishment\u201d that may be imposed after conviction, and not on whether the government may criminalize particular behavior, and therefore could not support the relief sought. The Court further held that the punishments imposed by Grants Pass under the challenged statute were not cruel and unusual. The majority opinion further rejected the argument that laws against camping criminalized the \u201cstatus\u201d of homelessness, reasoning that the challenged law applied to anyone who undertook the act of camping, rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 argument \u201ccamping, for people without other housing options, was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d and thus could not be criminalized. The Court therefore reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n\nIn a concurrence, Justice Thomas noted his opinion that the 1962 case rendering \u201cstatus crimes\u201d unconstitutional was wrongly decided, and rejected the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments clause governed civil penalties because they could later become criminal offenses. The dissenting opinion, authored by Justice Sotomayor and joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, urged that the Eighth Amendment prohibits criminalizing the status of homelessness by making it a crime to sleep outside when a person has no other place to sleep. The dissent further noted that the Court had not decided whether the ordinance violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause, Due Process, or state law.\n\nOn September 23, 2024, this matter was remanded to the district court for the limited purpose of approving a settlement agreement between the two parties. The parties informed the court that the matter was settled, and the case was dismissed without prejudice.",

    "target": "On October 15, 2018, individuals without secure housing filed this class-action lawsuit suing the city of Grants Pass, Oregon (the \u201cCity\u201d) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Represented by the Oregon Law Center, the plaintiffs challenged the City\u2019s enforcement of Grants Pass\u2019s anti-sleeping ordinance, anti-camping ordinance, park exclusion ordinance, and criminal trespass laws stemming from violations of these ordinances as unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S Constitution. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief prohibiting the City from enforcing the ordinances and criminal trespass laws until the class members had the opportunity to obtain shelter. The plaintiffs also sought declaratory relief as well as costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had contacted the City on September 10, 2018, to demand relief, but the parties were unable to resolve the dispute outside of court.\n\nThe case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Mark D. Clarke. Both parties consented to jurisdiction by a magistrate judge for the entirety of the case. On January 2, 2019, the City amended its ordinance, removing \u201csleeping\u201d from the definition of camping in an attempt to comply with a previous case, Martin v. Boise, which held that an ordinance punishing people for sleeping outside was unconstitutional when there was nowhere else for them to go. In amending its ordinance, the City meant to clarify that the act of \u201csleeping\u201d no longer automatically constituted illegal \u201ccamping,\u201d permitting those without shelter to sleep or rest in the City\u2019s parks.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 28, 2019, to add information about two additional plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on March 8, 2019, adding an additional individual to the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys.\n\nOn March 13, 2019, the plaintiffs moved to certify the class. After a hearing, Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification on August 7, 2019. 2019 WL 3717800. The court defined the class as: \"All involuntarily homeless individuals living in Grants Pass, Oregon, including homeless individuals who sometimes sleep outside city limits to avoid harassment and punishment by Defendant as addressed in this lawsuit.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs then filed their third amended complaint on November 13, 2019 to add an additional challenge to park exclusions under the Due Process Clause. On January 17, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and requested an oral argument. The defendant responded with a joint motion for summary judgment on February 28, 2020.\n\nOn July 22, 2020, Magistrate Judge Clarke denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and he granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the procedural due process claim because the park exclusions would go into effect immediately and were not stayed for appeal, leaving a person excluded from a park subject to arrest for reentry as soon as they received the exclusion notice. The court concluded that the deficient appeal procedures were unconstitutional and violated the procedural protections of due process. However, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their equal protection claim because the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the ordinances were selectively enforced and motivated by a discriminatory purpose. Likewise, summary judgment was denied on the plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process claim because they failed to convince the court that they had a liberty interest to sleep or camp in a public place and had not shown that the city engaged in \u201cconscience shocking behavior.\u201d 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nThe court also found that the ordinances violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment because they punished people for sleeping or resting outside with a blanket when they had no other place to go due to the City\u2019s lack of adequate shelter. The ordinances also violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment because the plaintiffs were being punished for trying to live, and likely could not afford to pay the fines, resulting in additional fees and punishments that made it even more difficult for them to find housing. 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nOn August 26, 2020, Judge Clarke issued an injunction enjoining the enforcement of three city ordinances against the plaintiff class. The City could not enforce the park exclusion ordinance, which allowed police officers to issue an order barring a person from all City park properties if the individual had been issued two or more citations violating regulations relating to city parks, or one citation violating state laws while on city park property. Unless it gave at least a 24-hour warning, the City also could not enforce the camping ordinances, which prohibited setting up or remaining on public property. Finally, the City could not enforce the criminal trespassing ordinance in city parks during nighttime hours.\n\nThat same day, the city of Grants Pass appealed the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment and its permanent injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35752). The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision on September 28, 2022, affirmed that the city\u2019s \u201canti-camping\u201d ordinance prohibiting individuals from using bedding supplies violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. The case was remanded with direction to the district court to narrow its injunction to only enjoin enforcement of ordinances against unhoused individuals who take necessary measures to keep themselves warm and safe when there is no shelter available. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit vacated the grant of summary judgment on the procedural due process claim and remanded with instructions to dismiss the claim as moot because the City amended the ordinance so it was no longer unconstitutional. 50 F.4th 787.\n\nIn the meantime, the plaintiffs filed a motion for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees on September 9, 2020. The parties thereafter, by October 5, 2020, reached an agreement for the plaintiffs to receive $300,000 with interest for their costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. 2020 WL 6060925. Three days later, on October 8, the City appealed to the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35881).\n\nThe City filed a petition for en banc review with the Ninth Circuit on November 14, 2022.\n\nOn July 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit amended the opinion it issued on September 28, 2022. It amended the order to deny the petition for rehearing en banc, reasoning that Grants Pass provided exceptionally limited protection and was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. The court further stated that future petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc would not be entertained in this case.\n\nIn response to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s denial for a rehearing en banc, the City filed a petition for writ of certiorari on August 22, 2023, requesting the Supreme Court to rule on whether laws regulating camping on public property constituted cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. 2023 WL 5530379.\n\nOn January 16, 2024, the Supreme Court granted certiorari. On June 28, 2024, the Supreme Court issued its decision, ruling 6-3 to reverse and remand. 2024 WL 3208072. \u00a0The majority\u2019s decision, written by Justice Gorsuch and joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, reasoned that the Eighth Amendment focuses on the \u201cmethod or kind of punishment\u201d that may be imposed after conviction, and not on whether the government may criminalize particular behavior, and therefore could not support the relief sought. The Court further held that the punishments imposed by Grants Pass under the challenged statute were not cruel and unusual. The majority opinion further rejected the argument that laws against camping criminalized the \u201cstatus\u201d of homelessness, reasoning that the challenged law applied to anyone who undertook the act of camping, rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 argument \u201ccamping, for people without other housing options, was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d and thus could not be criminalized. The Court therefore reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n\nIn a concurrence, Justice Thomas noted his opinion that the 1962 case rendering \u201cstatus crimes\u201d unconstitutional was wrongly decided, and rejected the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments clause governed civil penalties because they could later become criminal offenses. The dissenting opinion, authored by Justice Sotomayor and joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, urged that the Eighth Amendment prohibits criminalizing the status of homelessness by making it a crime to sleep outside when a person has no other place to sleep. The dissent further noted that the Court had not decided whether the ordinance violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause, Due Process, or state law.\n\nOn September 23, 2024, this matter was remanded to the district court for the limited purpose of approving a settlement agreement between the two parties. The parties informed the court that the matter was settled, and the case was dismissed without prejudice.",

It amended the order to deny the petition for rehearing en banc, reasoning that Grants Pass provided exceptionally limited protection and was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. The court further stated that future petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc would not be entertained in this case.\n\nIn response to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s denial for a rehearing en banc, the City filed a petition for writ of certiorari on August 22, 2023, requesting the Supreme Court to rule on whether laws regulating camping on public property constituted cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. 2023 WL 5530379.\n\nOn January 16, 2024, the Supreme Court granted certiorari. On June 28, 2024, the Supreme Court issued its decision, ruling 6-3 to reverse and remand. 2024 WL 3208072. \u00a0The majority\u2019s decision, written by Justice Gorsuch and joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, reasoned that the Eighth Amendment focuses on the \u201cmethod or kind of punishment\u201d that may be imposed after conviction, and not on whether the government may criminalize particular behavior, and therefore could not support the relief sought. The Court further held that the punishments imposed by Grants Pass under the challenged statute were not cruel and unusual. The majority opinion further rejected the argument that laws against camping criminalized the \u201cstatus\u201d of homelessness, reasoning that the challenged law applied to anyone who undertook the act of camping, rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 argument \u201ccamping, for people without other housing options, was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d and thus could not be criminalized. The Court therefore reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n\nIn a concurrence, Justice Thomas noted his opinion that the 1962 case rendering \u201cstatus crimes\u201d unconstitutional was wrongly decided, and rejected the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments clause governed civil penalties because they could later become criminal offenses. The dissenting opinion, authored by Justice Sotomayor and joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, urged that the Eighth Amendment prohibits criminalizing the status of homelessness by making it a crime to sleep outside when a person has no other place to sleep. The dissent further noted that the Court had not decided whether the ordinance violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause, Due Process, or state law.\n\nOn September 23, 2024, this matter was remanded to the district court for the limited purpose of approving a settlement agreement between the two parties. The parties informed the court that the matter was settled, and the case was dismissed without prejudice.",

    "target": "On October 15, 2018, individuals without secure housing filed this class-action lawsuit suing the city of Grants Pass, Oregon (the \u201cCity\u201d) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Represented by the Oregon Law Center, the plaintiffs challenged the City\u2019s enforcement of Grants Pass\u2019s anti-sleeping ordinance, anti-camping ordinance, park exclusion ordinance, and criminal trespass laws stemming from violations of these ordinances as unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S Constitution. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief prohibiting the City from enforcing the ordinances and criminal trespass laws until the class members had the opportunity to obtain shelter. The plaintiffs also sought declaratory relief as well as costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had contacted the City on September 10, 2018, to demand relief, but the parties were unable to resolve the dispute outside of court.\n\nThe case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Mark D. Clarke. Both parties consented to jurisdiction by a magistrate judge for the entirety of the case. On January 2, 2019, the City amended its ordinance, removing \u201csleeping\u201d from the definition of camping in an attempt to comply with a previous case, Martin v. Boise, which held that an ordinance punishing people for sleeping outside was unconstitutional when there was nowhere else for them to go. In amending its ordinance, the City meant to clarify that the act of \u201csleeping\u201d no longer automatically constituted illegal \u201ccamping,\u201d permitting those without shelter to sleep or rest in the City\u2019s parks.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 28, 2019, to add information about two additional plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on March 8, 2019, adding an additional individual to the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys.\n\nOn March 13, 2019, the plaintiffs moved to certify the class. After a hearing, Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification on August 7, 2019. 2019 WL 3717800. The court defined the class as: \"All involuntarily homeless individuals living in Grants Pass, Oregon, including homeless individuals who sometimes sleep outside city limits to avoid harassment and punishment by Defendant as addressed in this lawsuit.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs then filed their third amended complaint on November 13, 2019 to add an additional challenge to park exclusions under the Due Process Clause. On January 17, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and requested an oral argument. The defendant responded with a joint motion for summary judgment on February 28, 2020.\n\nOn July 22, 2020, Magistrate Judge Clarke denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and he granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the procedural due process claim because the park exclusions would go into effect immediately and were not stayed for appeal, leaving a person excluded from a park subject to arrest for reentry as soon as they received the exclusion notice. The court concluded that the deficient appeal procedures were unconstitutional and violated the procedural protections of due process. However, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their equal protection claim because the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the ordinances were selectively enforced and motivated by a discriminatory purpose. Likewise, summary judgment was denied on the plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process claim because they failed to convince the court that they had a liberty interest to sleep or camp in a public place and had not shown that the city engaged in \u201cconscience shocking behavior.\u201d 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nThe court also found that the ordinances violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment because they punished people for sleeping or resting outside with a blanket when they had no other place to go due to the City\u2019s lack of adequate shelter. The ordinances also violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment because the plaintiffs were being punished for trying to live, and likely could not afford to pay the fines, resulting in additional fees and punishments that made it even more difficult for them to find housing. 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nOn August 26, 2020, Judge Clarke issued an injunction enjoining the enforcement of three city ordinances against the plaintiff class. The City could not enforce the park exclusion ordinance, which allowed police officers to issue an order barring a person from all City park properties if the individual had been issued two or more citations violating regulations relating to city parks, or one citation violating state laws while on city park property. Unless it gave at least a 24-hour warning, the City also could not enforce the camping ordinances, which prohibited setting up or remaining on public property. Finally, the City could not enforce the criminal trespassing ordinance in city parks during nighttime hours.\n\nThat same day, the city of Grants Pass appealed the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment and its permanent injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35752). The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision on September 28, 2022, affirmed that the city\u2019s \u201canti-camping\u201d ordinance prohibiting individuals from using bedding supplies violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. The case was remanded with direction to the district court to narrow its injunction to only enjoin enforcement of ordinances against unhoused individuals who take necessary measures to keep themselves warm and safe when there is no shelter available. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit vacated the grant of summary judgment on the procedural due process claim and remanded with instructions to dismiss the claim as moot because the City amended the ordinance so it was no longer unconstitutional. 50 F.4th 787.\n\nIn the meantime, the plaintiffs filed a motion for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees on September 9, 2020. The parties thereafter, by October 5, 2020, reached an agreement for the plaintiffs to receive $300,000 with interest for their costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. 2020 WL 6060925.

Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit vacated the grant of summary judgment on the procedural due process claim and remanded with instructions to dismiss the claim as moot because the City amended the ordinance so it was no longer unconstitutional. 50 F.4th 787.\n\nIn the meantime, the plaintiffs filed a motion for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees on September 9, 2020. The parties thereafter, by October 5, 2020, reached an agreement for the plaintiffs to receive $300,000 with interest for their costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. 2020 WL 6060925. Three days later, on October 8, the City appealed to the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35881).\n\nThe City filed a petition for en banc review with the Ninth Circuit on November 14, 2022.\n\nOn July 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit amended the opinion it issued on September 28, 2022. It amended the order to deny the petition for rehearing en banc, reasoning that Grants Pass provided exceptionally limited protection and was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. The court further stated that future petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc would not be entertained in this case.\n\nIn response to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s denial for a rehearing en banc, the City filed a petition for writ of certiorari on August 22, 2023, requesting the Supreme Court to rule on whether laws regulating camping on public property constituted cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. 2023 WL 5530379.\n\nOn January 16, 2024, the Supreme Court granted certiorari. On June 28, 2024, the Supreme Court issued its decision, ruling 6-3 to reverse and remand. 2024 WL 3208072. \u00a0The majority\u2019s decision, written by Justice Gorsuch and joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, reasoned that the Eighth Amendment focuses on the \u201cmethod or kind of punishment\u201d that may be imposed after conviction, and not on whether the government may criminalize particular behavior, and therefore could not support the relief sought. The Court further held that the punishments imposed by Grants Pass under the challenged statute were not cruel and unusual. The majority opinion further rejected the argument that laws against camping criminalized the \u201cstatus\u201d of homelessness, reasoning that the challenged law applied to anyone who undertook the act of camping, rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 argument \u201ccamping, for people without other housing options, was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d and thus could not be criminalized. The Court therefore reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n\nIn a concurrence, Justice Thomas noted his opinion that the 1962 case rendering \u201cstatus crimes\u201d unconstitutional was wrongly decided, and rejected the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments clause governed civil penalties because they could later become criminal offenses. The dissenting opinion, authored by Justice Sotomayor and joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, urged that the Eighth Amendment prohibits criminalizing the status of homelessness by making it a crime to sleep outside when a person has no other place to sleep. The dissent further noted that the Court had not decided whether the ordinance violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause, Due Process, or state law.\n\nOn September 23, 2024, this matter was remanded to the district court for the limited purpose of approving a settlement agreement between the two parties. The parties informed the court that the matter was settled, and the case was dismissed without prejudice.",

    "target": "On October 15, 2018, individuals without secure housing filed this class-action lawsuit suing the city of Grants Pass, Oregon (the \u201cCity\u201d) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Represented by the Oregon Law Center, the plaintiffs challenged the City\u2019s enforcement of Grants Pass\u2019s anti-sleeping ordinance, anti-camping ordinance, park exclusion ordinance, and criminal trespass laws stemming from violations of these ordinances as unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S Constitution. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief prohibiting the City from enforcing the ordinances and criminal trespass laws until the class members had the opportunity to obtain shelter. The plaintiffs also sought declaratory relief as well as costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had contacted the City on September 10, 2018, to demand relief, but the parties were unable to resolve the dispute outside of court.\n\nThe case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Mark D. Clarke. Both parties consented to jurisdiction by a magistrate judge for the entirety of the case. On January 2, 2019, the City amended its ordinance, removing \u201csleeping\u201d from the definition of camping in an attempt to comply with a previous case, Martin v. Boise, which held that an ordinance punishing people for sleeping outside was unconstitutional when there was nowhere else for them to go. In amending its ordinance, the City meant to clarify that the act of \u201csleeping\u201d no longer automatically constituted illegal \u201ccamping,\u201d permitting those without shelter to sleep or rest in the City\u2019s parks.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 28, 2019, to add information about two additional plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on March 8, 2019, adding an additional individual to the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys.\n\nOn March 13, 2019, the plaintiffs moved to certify the class. After a hearing, Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification on August 7, 2019. 2019 WL 3717800. The court defined the class as: \"All involuntarily homeless individuals living in Grants Pass, Oregon, including homeless individuals who sometimes sleep outside city limits to avoid harassment and punishment by Defendant as addressed in this lawsuit.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs then filed their third amended complaint on November 13, 2019 to add an additional challenge to park exclusions under the Due Process Clause. On January 17, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and requested an oral argument. The defendant responded with a joint motion for summary judgment on February 28, 2020.\n\nOn July 22, 2020, Magistrate Judge Clarke denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and he granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the procedural due process claim because the park exclusions would go into effect immediately and were not stayed for appeal, leaving a person excluded from a park subject to arrest for reentry as soon as they received the exclusion notice. The court concluded that the deficient appeal procedures were unconstitutional and violated the procedural protections of due process. However, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their equal protection claim because the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the ordinances were selectively enforced and motivated by a discriminatory purpose. Likewise, summary judgment was denied on the plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process claim because they failed to convince the court that they had a liberty interest to sleep or camp in a public place and had not shown that the city engaged in \u201cconscience shocking behavior.\u201d 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nThe court also found that the ordinances violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment because they punished people for sleeping or resting outside with a blanket when they had no other place to go due to the City\u2019s lack of adequate shelter. The ordinances also violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment because the plaintiffs were being punished for trying to live, and likely could not afford to pay the fines, resulting in additional fees and punishments that made it even more difficult for them to find housing. 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nOn August 26, 2020, Judge Clarke issued an injunction enjoining the enforcement of three city ordinances against the plaintiff class. The City could not enforce the park exclusion ordinance, which allowed police officers to issue an order barring a person from all City park properties if the individual had been issued two or more citations violating regulations relating to city parks, or one citation violating state laws while on city park property. Unless it gave at least a 24-hour warning, the City also could not enforce the camping ordinances, which prohibited setting up or remaining on public property. Finally, the City could not enforce the criminal trespassing ordinance in city parks during nighttime hours.\n\nThat same day, the city of Grants Pass appealed the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment and its permanent injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35752). The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision on September 28, 2022, affirmed that the city\u2019s \u201canti-camping\u201d ordinance prohibiting individuals from using bedding supplies violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. The case was remanded with direction to the district court to narrow its injunction to only enjoin enforcement of ordinances against unhoused individuals who take necessary measures to keep themselves warm and safe when there is no shelter available. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit vacated the grant of summary judgment on the procedural due process claim and remanded with instructions to dismiss the claim as moot because the City amended the ordinance so it was no longer unconstitutional. 50 F.4th 787.\n\nIn the meantime, the plaintiffs filed a motion for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees on September 9, 2020.

Three days later, on October 8, the City appealed to the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35881).\n\nThe City filed a petition for en banc review with the Ninth Circuit on November 14, 2022.\n\nOn July 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit amended the opinion it issued on September 28, 2022.
