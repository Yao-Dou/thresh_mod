    "target": "This case challenged Florida's and the Trump Administration's construction of an immigration detention facility dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz\" in the Everglades. The facility was built in mere days, which plaintiffs alleged circumvented or ignored regulatory and environmental standards. Designed to hold up to 5,000 noncitizens at a time, the facility was located on the grounds of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. Although the airport was located in Collier County, 36 miles west of Miami, it was owned by Miami-Dade County and operated by that county's aviation department. Miami-Dade County regulations limited the use of the site to aviation purposes. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis stated that the facility's construction was requested, and would be fully bankrolled, by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) using Federal Emergency Management Agency funds. Plaintiffs alleged violations of: the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); the Administrative Procedure Act (APA); and Miami-Dade County Code.\u00a0 They also alleged that defendants' actions were ultra vires\u00a0(i.e., in excess of their legal authority to act).\n\nPlaintiffs were two Florida-based environmental nonprofits, Friends of the Everglades and Center for Biological Diversity. On June 27, 2025, they filed this action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against DHS and its Secretary; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its Acting Director; the Florida Division of Emergency Management and its Executive Director; and Miami-Dade County. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that defendants' actions were unlawful, an injunction against the continued construction and use of the facility for non-aviation purposes including immigration detention, and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Jose E. Martinez. The same day, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction; they renewed that motion on July 17, 2025.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, Miami-Dade County filed its response. The County argued that the state of Florida had commandeered the airport under state emergency authority and that it could not use county law to restrain the state; additionally, the County contended that plaintiffs did not have a right of action to compel the County to enforce its own regulations. The same day, the Executive Director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management filed his response, arguing that plaintiffs' complaint alleged only violations of federal law which did not bind him and his state agency.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, DHS and ICE filed their response. The federal agencies argued that plaintiffs' case was likely to fail because it did not challenge a final agency action, and did not show that they would suffer an irreparable harm from the detention center's construction given Supreme Court precedent that NEPA violations do not give rise to a presumption of irreparable injury.\n\nOn July 14, 2025, the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida moved to intervene as a plaintiff in the case. The Tribe noted that Big Cypress National Preserve, which included the land co-opted to build the detention center, had traditionally been part of its home and that the center's continued construction and operation would accelerate the land's environmental degradation. The court granted the Tribe's motion to intervene on July 30, 2025.\n\nTwo days later, Judge Martinez recused himself from the case. The case was automatically reassigned to Judge Kathleen M. Williams.\n\nOn July 28, 2025, the court granted in part plaintiffs' motion for expedited discovery. 2025 WL 2253243. Defendants were ordered to produce any agreements among themselves relating to Alligator Alcatraz. The next day, defendants filed a motion requesting limited reciprocal discovery from plaintiffs; that motion is still pending before the court.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, while a multi-day hearing on the preliminary injunction motion was ongoing, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' renewed motion for a limited temporary restraining order. First, it noted that it would withhold ruling on the defendants' venue challenge until the conclusion of the preliminary injunction hearing. It further rejected defendants' challenge to the court's jurisdiction, reasoning that because the plaintiffs did not seek to enjoin or restrain the operation of any immigration statute, the statute cited by the defendants to assert lack of jurisdiction was inapplicable.\u00a0 As to the TRO, the court concluded that, at minimum, the federal defendants' legal control over the facility's operations, evidence that it was constructed at the request of DHS, and regular inspections of the site by ICE officials, as well as undisputed lack of prior environmental assessment under NEPA, created a sufficient likelihood of success of the merits of the APA claim to warrant preliminary relief. Citing minimal harm to the defendants from briefly suspending expansion of the facility and the difficulty of reversing course at a later date, the court entered a temporary restraining order that prohibited the state and federal defendants from installing any additional industrial-style lighting, doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing, or doing any other site expansion including placing or erecting buildings and other structures. The TRO was to last fourteen days from the date of the order or until the court entered an order on the preliminary injunction.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, after a hearing, the court granting in part plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 242325. First, it again found that it had jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claim, which neither challenged the fact nor the manner of detention or removal, nor sought to halt, suspend, or alter operation of any INA provision, nor otherwise challenged the defendants' authority to implement or enforce immigration laws (as would preclude jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. 1252).\u00a0 Next, the court held that the defendants had waived challenge to venue in the Southern District of Florida by litigating the case on the merits for a month before raising venue issues.\u00a0 Rejecting the venue argument on the merits, it reasoned that the NEPA claim did not involve \"real property\" within the meaning of the applicable venue statute and therefore that venue was proper in the Southern District as the home of plaintiff's principal place of business, and not required to lie in the Middle District of Florida, where the facility is located.\u00a0 Moreover, a substantial portion of events that gave rise to the lawsuit took place within the Southern District, and some of the environmental concerns relevant to the NEPA claim would also affect the Southern District. Finally, the court found that the plaintiffs met the criteria for issuance of a preliminary injunction. As to a likelihood of success on the merits of plaintiffs' NEPA claims, the court noted that the defendants did not dispute the \"major\" environmental effects that would justify the need for an environmental impact statement or assessment.\u00a0 Moreover, the decision to construct the detention camp without issuing an impact statement or conducting an assessment was a definitive position that caused actual, concrete injury to the plaintiffs' recreational and conservational interests, and therefore constituted a final agency action. In addition, evidence the federal defendants requested that the facility be built and committed federal funding precluded them from disclaiming involvement or responsibility under NEPA.\u00a0 The environmental risks posed by the facility threatened irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, and the balance of equities and the public interest similarly favored granting the preliminary injunction.\n\nTherefore, the court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any person in active concert or participation with them from (1) installing any additional industrial-style lighting (so-called \u201cSunbelt\u201d lighting); or doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing; or doing any other site expansion, including placing or erecting any additional buildings, tents, dormitories, or other residential or administrative facilities on the TNT site; and (2) bringing any additional persons onto the TNT site who were not already being detained at the site at the time the order went into effect. The preliminary injunction did not prohibit modification or repairs to existing facilities that were made for the purpose of increasing safety or mitigating environmental or other risks at the site. It further ordered that after no more than sixty days, and once population attrition allowed for safe implementation, the defendants were to remove 1) the temporary fencing in order to allow tribe members access to the site consistent with the access they enjoyed before the facility was built; 2) the Sunbelt lighting fixtures and any additional lighting installed for the use of the property as a detention facility; and 3) all generators, gas, sewage, and other waste and waste receptacles that were installed for this project.\n\nThat same day, the defendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal, appealing the district court's preliminary injunction ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. On August 23, 2025, the defendants filed a district court motion to stay the injunction pending appeal and, on August 26, 2025, they filed a similar motion in the appellate court.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

In addition, evidence the federal defendants requested that the facility be built and committed federal funding precluded them from disclaiming involvement or responsibility under NEPA.\u00a0 The environmental risks posed by the facility threatened irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, and the balance of equities and the public interest similarly favored granting the preliminary injunction.\n\nTherefore, the court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any person in active concert or participation with them from (1) installing any additional industrial-style lighting (so-called \u201cSunbelt\u201d lighting); or doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing; or doing any other site expansion, including placing or erecting any additional buildings, tents, dormitories, or other residential or administrative facilities on the TNT site; and (2) bringing any additional persons onto the TNT site who were not already being detained at the site at the time the order went into effect. The preliminary injunction did not prohibit modification or repairs to existing facilities that were made for the purpose of increasing safety or mitigating environmental or other risks at the site. It further ordered that after no more than sixty days, and once population attrition allowed for safe implementation, the defendants were to remove 1) the temporary fencing in order to allow tribe members access to the site consistent with the access they enjoyed before the facility was built; 2) the Sunbelt lighting fixtures and any additional lighting installed for the use of the property as a detention facility; and 3) all generators, gas, sewage, and other waste and waste receptacles that were installed for this project.\n\nThat same day, the defendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal, appealing the district court's preliminary injunction ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. On August 23, 2025, the defendants filed a district court motion to stay the injunction pending appeal and, on August 26, 2025, they filed a similar motion in the appellate court.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged Florida's and the Trump Administration's construction of an immigration detention facility dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz\" in the Everglades. The facility was built in mere days, which plaintiffs alleged circumvented or ignored regulatory and environmental standards. Designed to hold up to 5,000 noncitizens at a time, the facility was located on the grounds of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. Although the airport was located in Collier County, 36 miles west of Miami, it was owned by Miami-Dade County and operated by that county's aviation department. Miami-Dade County regulations limited the use of the site to aviation purposes. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis stated that the facility's construction was requested, and would be fully bankrolled, by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) using Federal Emergency Management Agency funds. Plaintiffs alleged violations of: the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); the Administrative Procedure Act (APA); and Miami-Dade County Code.\u00a0 They also alleged that defendants' actions were ultra vires\u00a0(i.e., in excess of their legal authority to act).\n\nPlaintiffs were two Florida-based environmental nonprofits, Friends of the Everglades and Center for Biological Diversity. On June 27, 2025, they filed this action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against DHS and its Secretary; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its Acting Director; the Florida Division of Emergency Management and its Executive Director; and Miami-Dade County. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that defendants' actions were unlawful, an injunction against the continued construction and use of the facility for non-aviation purposes including immigration detention, and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Jose E. Martinez. The same day, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction; they renewed that motion on July 17, 2025.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, Miami-Dade County filed its response. The County argued that the state of Florida had commandeered the airport under state emergency authority and that it could not use county law to restrain the state; additionally, the County contended that plaintiffs did not have a right of action to compel the County to enforce its own regulations. The same day, the Executive Director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management filed his response, arguing that plaintiffs' complaint alleged only violations of federal law which did not bind him and his state agency.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, DHS and ICE filed their response. The federal agencies argued that plaintiffs' case was likely to fail because it did not challenge a final agency action, and did not show that they would suffer an irreparable harm from the detention center's construction given Supreme Court precedent that NEPA violations do not give rise to a presumption of irreparable injury.\n\nOn July 14, 2025, the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida moved to intervene as a plaintiff in the case. The Tribe noted that Big Cypress National Preserve, which included the land co-opted to build the detention center, had traditionally been part of its home and that the center's continued construction and operation would accelerate the land's environmental degradation. The court granted the Tribe's motion to intervene on July 30, 2025.\n\nTwo days later, Judge Martinez recused himself from the case. The case was automatically reassigned to Judge Kathleen M. Williams.\n\nOn July 28, 2025, the court granted in part plaintiffs' motion for expedited discovery. 2025 WL 2253243. Defendants were ordered to produce any agreements among themselves relating to Alligator Alcatraz. The next day, defendants filed a motion requesting limited reciprocal discovery from plaintiffs; that motion is still pending before the court.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, while a multi-day hearing on the preliminary injunction motion was ongoing, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' renewed motion for a limited temporary restraining order. First, it noted that it would withhold ruling on the defendants' venue challenge until the conclusion of the preliminary injunction hearing. It further rejected defendants' challenge to the court's jurisdiction, reasoning that because the plaintiffs did not seek to enjoin or restrain the operation of any immigration statute, the statute cited by the defendants to assert lack of jurisdiction was inapplicable.\u00a0 As to the TRO, the court concluded that, at minimum, the federal defendants' legal control over the facility's operations, evidence that it was constructed at the request of DHS, and regular inspections of the site by ICE officials, as well as undisputed lack of prior environmental assessment under NEPA, created a sufficient likelihood of success of the merits of the APA claim to warrant preliminary relief. Citing minimal harm to the defendants from briefly suspending expansion of the facility and the difficulty of reversing course at a later date, the court entered a temporary restraining order that prohibited the state and federal defendants from installing any additional industrial-style lighting, doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing, or doing any other site expansion including placing or erecting buildings and other structures. The TRO was to last fourteen days from the date of the order or until the court entered an order on the preliminary injunction.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, after a hearing, the court granting in part plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 242325. First, it again found that it had jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claim, which neither challenged the fact nor the manner of detention or removal, nor sought to halt, suspend, or alter operation of any INA provision, nor otherwise challenged the defendants' authority to implement or enforce immigration laws (as would preclude jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. 1252).\u00a0 Next, the court held that the defendants had waived challenge to venue in the Southern District of Florida by litigating the case on the merits for a month before raising venue issues.\u00a0 Rejecting the venue argument on the merits, it reasoned that the NEPA claim did not involve \"real property\" within the meaning of the applicable venue statute and therefore that venue was proper in the Southern District as the home of plaintiff's principal place of business, and not required to lie in the Middle District of Florida, where the facility is located.\u00a0 Moreover, a substantial portion of events that gave rise to the lawsuit took place within the Southern District, and some of the environmental concerns relevant to the NEPA claim would also affect the Southern District. Finally, the court found that the plaintiffs met the criteria for issuance of a preliminary injunction. As to a likelihood of success on the merits of plaintiffs' NEPA claims, the court noted that the defendants did not dispute the \"major\" environmental effects that would justify the need for an environmental impact statement or assessment.\u00a0 Moreover, the decision to construct the detention camp without issuing an impact statement or conducting an assessment was a definitive position that caused actual, concrete injury to the plaintiffs' recreational and conservational interests, and therefore constituted a final agency action. In addition, evidence the federal defendants requested that the facility be built and committed federal funding precluded them from disclaiming involvement or responsibility under NEPA.\u00a0 The environmental risks posed by the facility threatened irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, and the balance of equities and the public interest similarly favored granting the preliminary injunction.\n\nTherefore, the court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any person in active concert or participation with them from (1) installing any additional industrial-style lighting (so-called \u201cSunbelt\u201d lighting); or doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing; or doing any other site expansion, including placing or erecting any additional buildings, tents, dormitories, or other residential or administrative facilities on the TNT site; and (2) bringing any additional persons onto the TNT site who were not already being detained at the site at the time the order went into effect. The preliminary injunction did not prohibit modification or repairs to existing facilities that were made for the purpose of increasing safety or mitigating environmental or other risks at the site. It further ordered that after no more than sixty days, and once population attrition allowed for safe implementation, the defendants were to remove 1) the temporary fencing in order to allow tribe members access to the site consistent with the access they enjoyed before the facility was built; 2) the Sunbelt lighting fixtures and any additional lighting installed for the use of the property as a detention facility; and 3) all generators, gas, sewage, and other waste and waste receptacles that were installed for this project.\n\nThat same day, the defendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal, appealing the district court's preliminary injunction ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. On August 23, 2025, the defendants filed a district court motion to stay the injunction pending appeal and, on August 26, 2025, they filed a similar motion in the appellate court.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged Florida's and the Trump Administration's construction of an immigration detention facility dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz\" in the Everglades. The facility was built in mere days, which plaintiffs alleged circumvented or ignored regulatory and environmental standards. Designed to hold up to 5,000 noncitizens at a time, the facility was located on the grounds of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. Although the airport was located in Collier County, 36 miles west of Miami, it was owned by Miami-Dade County and operated by that county's aviation department. Miami-Dade County regulations limited the use of the site to aviation purposes. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis stated that the facility's construction was requested, and would be fully bankrolled, by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) using Federal Emergency Management Agency funds. Plaintiffs alleged violations of: the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); the Administrative Procedure Act (APA); and Miami-Dade County Code.\u00a0 They also alleged that defendants' actions were ultra vires\u00a0(i.e., in excess of their legal authority to act).\n\nPlaintiffs were two Florida-based environmental nonprofits, Friends of the Everglades and Center for Biological Diversity. On June 27, 2025, they filed this action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against DHS and its Secretary; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its Acting Director; the Florida Division of Emergency Management and its Executive Director; and Miami-Dade County. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that defendants' actions were unlawful, an injunction against the continued construction and use of the facility for non-aviation purposes including immigration detention, and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Jose E. Martinez. The same day, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction; they renewed that motion on July 17, 2025.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, Miami-Dade County filed its response. The County argued that the state of Florida had commandeered the airport under state emergency authority and that it could not use county law to restrain the state; additionally, the County contended that plaintiffs did not have a right of action to compel the County to enforce its own regulations. The same day, the Executive Director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management filed his response, arguing that plaintiffs' complaint alleged only violations of federal law which did not bind him and his state agency.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, DHS and ICE filed their response. The federal agencies argued that plaintiffs' case was likely to fail because it did not challenge a final agency action, and did not show that they would suffer an irreparable harm from the detention center's construction given Supreme Court precedent that NEPA violations do not give rise to a presumption of irreparable injury.\n\nOn July 14, 2025, the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida moved to intervene as a plaintiff in the case. The Tribe noted that Big Cypress National Preserve, which included the land co-opted to build the detention center, had traditionally been part of its home and that the center's continued construction and operation would accelerate the land's environmental degradation. The court granted the Tribe's motion to intervene on July 30, 2025.\n\nTwo days later, Judge Martinez recused himself from the case. The case was automatically reassigned to Judge Kathleen M. Williams.\n\nOn July 28, 2025, the court granted in part plaintiffs' motion for expedited discovery. 2025 WL 2253243. Defendants were ordered to produce any agreements among themselves relating to Alligator Alcatraz. The next day, defendants filed a motion requesting limited reciprocal discovery from plaintiffs; that motion is still pending before the court.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, while a multi-day hearing on the preliminary injunction motion was ongoing, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' renewed motion for a limited temporary restraining order. First, it noted that it would withhold ruling on the defendants' venue challenge until the conclusion of the preliminary injunction hearing. It further rejected defendants' challenge to the court's jurisdiction, reasoning that because the plaintiffs did not seek to enjoin or restrain the operation of any immigration statute, the statute cited by the defendants to assert lack of jurisdiction was inapplicable.\u00a0 As to the TRO, the court concluded that, at minimum, the federal defendants' legal control over the facility's operations, evidence that it was constructed at the request of DHS, and regular inspections of the site by ICE officials, as well as undisputed lack of prior environmental assessment under NEPA, created a sufficient likelihood of success of the merits of the APA claim to warrant preliminary relief. Citing minimal harm to the defendants from briefly suspending expansion of the facility and the difficulty of reversing course at a later date, the court entered a temporary restraining order that prohibited the state and federal defendants from installing any additional industrial-style lighting, doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing, or doing any other site expansion including placing or erecting buildings and other structures. The TRO was to last fourteen days from the date of the order or until the court entered an order on the preliminary injunction.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, after a hearing, the court granting in part plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 242325. First, it again found that it had jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claim, which neither challenged the fact nor the manner of detention or removal, nor sought to halt, suspend, or alter operation of any INA provision, nor otherwise challenged the defendants' authority to implement or enforce immigration laws (as would preclude jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. 1252).\u00a0 Next, the court held that the defendants had waived challenge to venue in the Southern District of Florida by litigating the case on the merits for a month before raising venue issues.\u00a0 Rejecting the venue argument on the merits, it reasoned that the NEPA claim did not involve \"real property\" within the meaning of the applicable venue statute and therefore that venue was proper in the Southern District as the home of plaintiff's principal place of business, and not required to lie in the Middle District of Florida, where the facility is located.\u00a0 Moreover, a substantial portion of events that gave rise to the lawsuit took place within the Southern District, and some of the environmental concerns relevant to the NEPA claim would also affect the Southern District. Finally, the court found that the plaintiffs met the criteria for issuance of a preliminary injunction. As to a likelihood of success on the merits of plaintiffs' NEPA claims, the court noted that the defendants did not dispute the \"major\" environmental effects that would justify the need for an environmental impact statement or assessment.\u00a0 Moreover, the decision to construct the detention camp without issuing an impact statement or conducting an assessment was a definitive position that caused actual, concrete injury to the plaintiffs' recreational and conservational interests, and therefore constituted a final agency action. In addition, evidence the federal defendants requested that the facility be built and committed federal funding precluded them from disclaiming involvement or responsibility under NEPA.\u00a0 The environmental risks posed by the facility threatened irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, and the balance of equities and the public interest similarly favored granting the preliminary injunction.\n\nTherefore, the court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any person in active concert or participation with them from (1) installing any additional industrial-style lighting (so-called \u201cSunbelt\u201d lighting); or doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing; or doing any other site expansion, including placing or erecting any additional buildings, tents, dormitories, or other residential or administrative facilities on the TNT site; and (2) bringing any additional persons onto the TNT site who were not already being detained at the site at the time the order went into effect. The preliminary injunction did not prohibit modification or repairs to existing facilities that were made for the purpose of increasing safety or mitigating environmental or other risks at the site. It further ordered that after no more than sixty days, and once population attrition allowed for safe implementation, the defendants were to remove 1) the temporary fencing in order to allow tribe members access to the site consistent with the access they enjoyed before the facility was built; 2) the Sunbelt lighting fixtures and any additional lighting installed for the use of the property as a detention facility; and 3) all generators, gas, sewage, and other waste and waste receptacles that were installed for this project.\n\nThat same day, the defendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal, appealing the district court's preliminary injunction ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. On August 23, 2025, the defendants filed a district court motion to stay the injunction pending appeal and, on August 26, 2025, they filed a similar motion in the appellate court.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged Florida's and the Trump Administration's construction of an immigration detention facility dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz\" in the Everglades. The facility was built in mere days, which plaintiffs alleged circumvented or ignored regulatory and environmental standards. Designed to hold up to 5,000 noncitizens at a time, the facility was located on the grounds of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. Although the airport was located in Collier County, 36 miles west of Miami, it was owned by Miami-Dade County and operated by that county's aviation department. Miami-Dade County regulations limited the use of the site to aviation purposes. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis stated that the facility's construction was requested, and would be fully bankrolled, by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) using Federal Emergency Management Agency funds. Plaintiffs alleged violations of: the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); the Administrative Procedure Act (APA); and Miami-Dade County Code.\u00a0 They also alleged that defendants' actions were ultra vires\u00a0(i.e., in excess of their legal authority to act).\n\nPlaintiffs were two Florida-based environmental nonprofits, Friends of the Everglades and Center for Biological Diversity. On June 27, 2025, they filed this action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against DHS and its Secretary; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its Acting Director; the Florida Division of Emergency Management and its Executive Director; and Miami-Dade County. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that defendants' actions were unlawful, an injunction against the continued construction and use of the facility for non-aviation purposes including immigration detention, and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Jose E. Martinez. The same day, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction; they renewed that motion on July 17, 2025.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, Miami-Dade County filed its response. The County argued that the state of Florida had commandeered the airport under state emergency authority and that it could not use county law to restrain the state; additionally, the County contended that plaintiffs did not have a right of action to compel the County to enforce its own regulations. The same day, the Executive Director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management filed his response, arguing that plaintiffs' complaint alleged only violations of federal law which did not bind him and his state agency.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, DHS and ICE filed their response. The federal agencies argued that plaintiffs' case was likely to fail because it did not challenge a final agency action, and did not show that they would suffer an irreparable harm from the detention center's construction given Supreme Court precedent that NEPA violations do not give rise to a presumption of irreparable injury.\n\nOn July 14, 2025, the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida moved to intervene as a plaintiff in the case. The Tribe noted that Big Cypress National Preserve, which included the land co-opted to build the detention center, had traditionally been part of its home and that the center's continued construction and operation would accelerate the land's environmental degradation. The court granted the Tribe's motion to intervene on July 30, 2025.\n\nTwo days later, Judge Martinez recused himself from the case. The case was automatically reassigned to Judge Kathleen M. Williams.\n\nOn July 28, 2025, the court granted in part plaintiffs' motion for expedited discovery. 2025 WL 2253243. Defendants were ordered to produce any agreements among themselves relating to Alligator Alcatraz. The next day, defendants filed a motion requesting limited reciprocal discovery from plaintiffs; that motion is still pending before the court.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, while a multi-day hearing on the preliminary injunction motion was ongoing, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' renewed motion for a limited temporary restraining order. First, it noted that it would withhold ruling on the defendants' venue challenge until the conclusion of the preliminary injunction hearing. It further rejected defendants' challenge to the court's jurisdiction, reasoning that because the plaintiffs did not seek to enjoin or restrain the operation of any immigration statute, the statute cited by the defendants to assert lack of jurisdiction was inapplicable.\u00a0 As to the TRO, the court concluded that, at minimum, the federal defendants' legal control over the facility's operations, evidence that it was constructed at the request of DHS, and regular inspections of the site by ICE officials, as well as undisputed lack of prior environmental assessment under NEPA, created a sufficient likelihood of success of the merits of the APA claim to warrant preliminary relief. Citing minimal harm to the defendants from briefly suspending expansion of the facility and the difficulty of reversing course at a later date, the court entered a temporary restraining order that prohibited the state and federal defendants from installing any additional industrial-style lighting, doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing, or doing any other site expansion including placing or erecting buildings and other structures. The TRO was to last fourteen days from the date of the order or until the court entered an order on the preliminary injunction.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, after a hearing, the court granting in part plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 242325. First, it again found that it had jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claim, which neither challenged the fact nor the manner of detention or removal, nor sought to halt, suspend, or alter operation of any INA provision, nor otherwise challenged the defendants' authority to implement or enforce immigration laws (as would preclude jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. 1252).\u00a0 Next, the court held that the defendants had waived challenge to venue in the Southern District of Florida by litigating the case on the merits for a month before raising venue issues.\u00a0 Rejecting the venue argument on the merits, it reasoned that the NEPA claim did not involve \"real property\" within the meaning of the applicable venue statute and therefore that venue was proper in the Southern District as the home of plaintiff's principal place of business, and not required to lie in the Middle District of Florida, where the facility is located.\u00a0 Moreover, a substantial portion of events that gave rise to the lawsuit took place within the Southern District, and some of the environmental concerns relevant to the NEPA claim would also affect the Southern District. Finally, the court found that the plaintiffs met the criteria for issuance of a preliminary injunction. As to a likelihood of success on the merits of plaintiffs' NEPA claims, the court noted that the defendants did not dispute the \"major\" environmental effects that would justify the need for an environmental impact statement or assessment.\u00a0 Moreover, the decision to construct the detention camp without issuing an impact statement or conducting an assessment was a definitive position that caused actual, concrete injury to the plaintiffs' recreational and conservational interests, and therefore constituted a final agency action. In addition, evidence the federal defendants requested that the facility be built and committed federal funding precluded them from disclaiming involvement or responsibility under NEPA.\u00a0 The environmental risks posed by the facility threatened irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, and the balance of equities and the public interest similarly favored granting the preliminary injunction.\n\nTherefore, the court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any person in active concert or participation with them from (1) installing any additional industrial-style lighting (so-called \u201cSunbelt\u201d lighting); or doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing; or doing any other site expansion, including placing or erecting any additional buildings, tents, dormitories, or other residential or administrative facilities on the TNT site; and (2) bringing any additional persons onto the TNT site who were not already being detained at the site at the time the order went into effect. The preliminary injunction did not prohibit modification or repairs to existing facilities that were made for the purpose of increasing safety or mitigating environmental or other risks at the site. It further ordered that after no more than sixty days, and once population attrition allowed for safe implementation, the defendants were to remove 1) the temporary fencing in order to allow tribe members access to the site consistent with the access they enjoyed before the facility was built; 2) the Sunbelt lighting fixtures and any additional lighting installed for the use of the property as a detention facility; and 3) all generators, gas, sewage, and other waste and waste receptacles that were installed for this project.\n\nThat same day, the defendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal, appealing the district court's preliminary injunction ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. On August 23, 2025, the defendants filed a district court motion to stay the injunction pending appeal and, on August 26, 2025, they filed a similar motion in the appellate court.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

The federal agencies argued that plaintiffs' case was likely to fail because it did not challenge a final agency action, and did not show that they would suffer an irreparable harm from the detention center's construction given Supreme Court precedent that NEPA violations do not give rise to a presumption of irreparable injury.\n\nOn July 14, 2025, the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida moved to intervene as a plaintiff in the case. The Tribe noted that Big Cypress National Preserve, which included the land co-opted to build the detention center, had traditionally been part of its home and that the center's continued construction and operation would accelerate the land's environmental degradation. The court granted the Tribe's motion to intervene on July 30, 2025.\n\nTwo days later, Judge Martinez recused himself from the case. The case was automatically reassigned to Judge Kathleen M. Williams.\n\nOn July 28, 2025, the court granted in part plaintiffs' motion for expedited discovery. 2025 WL 2253243. Defendants were ordered to produce any agreements among themselves relating to Alligator Alcatraz. The next day, defendants filed a motion requesting limited reciprocal discovery from plaintiffs; that motion is still pending before the court.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, while a multi-day hearing on the preliminary injunction motion was ongoing, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' renewed motion for a limited temporary restraining order. First, it noted that it would withhold ruling on the defendants' venue challenge until the conclusion of the preliminary injunction hearing. It further rejected defendants' challenge to the court's jurisdiction, reasoning that because the plaintiffs did not seek to enjoin or restrain the operation of any immigration statute, the statute cited by the defendants to assert lack of jurisdiction was inapplicable.\u00a0 As to the TRO, the court concluded that, at minimum, the federal defendants' legal control over the facility's operations, evidence that it was constructed at the request of DHS, and regular inspections of the site by ICE officials, as well as undisputed lack of prior environmental assessment under NEPA, created a sufficient likelihood of success of the merits of the APA claim to warrant preliminary relief. Citing minimal harm to the defendants from briefly suspending expansion of the facility and the difficulty of reversing course at a later date, the court entered a temporary restraining order that prohibited the state and federal defendants from installing any additional industrial-style lighting, doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing, or doing any other site expansion including placing or erecting buildings and other structures. The TRO was to last fourteen days from the date of the order or until the court entered an order on the preliminary injunction.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, after a hearing, the court granting in part plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 242325. First, it again found that it had jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claim, which neither challenged the fact nor the manner of detention or removal, nor sought to halt, suspend, or alter operation of any INA provision, nor otherwise challenged the defendants' authority to implement or enforce immigration laws (as would preclude jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. 1252).\u00a0 Next, the court held that the defendants had waived challenge to venue in the Southern District of Florida by litigating the case on the merits for a month before raising venue issues.\u00a0 Rejecting the venue argument on the merits, it reasoned that the NEPA claim did not involve \"real property\" within the meaning of the applicable venue statute and therefore that venue was proper in the Southern District as the home of plaintiff's principal place of business, and not required to lie in the Middle District of Florida, where the facility is located.\u00a0 Moreover, a substantial portion of events that gave rise to the lawsuit took place within the Southern District, and some of the environmental concerns relevant to the NEPA claim would also affect the Southern District. Finally, the court found that the plaintiffs met the criteria for issuance of a preliminary injunction. As to a likelihood of success on the merits of plaintiffs' NEPA claims, the court noted that the defendants did not dispute the \"major\" environmental effects that would justify the need for an environmental impact statement or assessment.\u00a0 Moreover, the decision to construct the detention camp without issuing an impact statement or conducting an assessment was a definitive position that caused actual, concrete injury to the plaintiffs' recreational and conservational interests, and therefore constituted a final agency action. In addition, evidence the federal defendants requested that the facility be built and committed federal funding precluded them from disclaiming involvement or responsibility under NEPA.\u00a0 The environmental risks posed by the facility threatened irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, and the balance of equities and the public interest similarly favored granting the preliminary injunction.\n\nTherefore, the court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any person in active concert or participation with them from (1) installing any additional industrial-style lighting (so-called \u201cSunbelt\u201d lighting); or doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing; or doing any other site expansion, including placing or erecting any additional buildings, tents, dormitories, or other residential or administrative facilities on the TNT site; and (2) bringing any additional persons onto the TNT site who were not already being detained at the site at the time the order went into effect. The preliminary injunction did not prohibit modification or repairs to existing facilities that were made for the purpose of increasing safety or mitigating environmental or other risks at the site. It further ordered that after no more than sixty days, and once population attrition allowed for safe implementation, the defendants were to remove 1) the temporary fencing in order to allow tribe members access to the site consistent with the access they enjoyed before the facility was built; 2) the Sunbelt lighting fixtures and any additional lighting installed for the use of the property as a detention facility; and 3) all generators, gas, sewage, and other waste and waste receptacles that were installed for this project.\n\nThat same day, the defendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal, appealing the district court's preliminary injunction ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. On August 23, 2025, the defendants filed a district court motion to stay the injunction pending appeal and, on August 26, 2025, they filed a similar motion in the appellate court.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged Florida's and the Trump Administration's construction of an immigration detention facility dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz\" in the Everglades. The facility was built in mere days, which plaintiffs alleged circumvented or ignored regulatory and environmental standards. Designed to hold up to 5,000 noncitizens at a time, the facility was located on the grounds of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. Although the airport was located in Collier County, 36 miles west of Miami, it was owned by Miami-Dade County and operated by that county's aviation department. Miami-Dade County regulations limited the use of the site to aviation purposes. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis stated that the facility's construction was requested, and would be fully bankrolled, by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) using Federal Emergency Management Agency funds. Plaintiffs alleged violations of: the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); the Administrative Procedure Act (APA); and Miami-Dade County Code.\u00a0 They also alleged that defendants' actions were ultra vires\u00a0(i.e., in excess of their legal authority to act).\n\nPlaintiffs were two Florida-based environmental nonprofits, Friends of the Everglades and Center for Biological Diversity. On June 27, 2025, they filed this action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against DHS and its Secretary; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its Acting Director; the Florida Division of Emergency Management and its Executive Director; and Miami-Dade County. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that defendants' actions were unlawful, an injunction against the continued construction and use of the facility for non-aviation purposes including immigration detention, and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Jose E. Martinez. The same day, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction; they renewed that motion on July 17, 2025.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, Miami-Dade County filed its response. The County argued that the state of Florida had commandeered the airport under state emergency authority and that it could not use county law to restrain the state; additionally, the County contended that plaintiffs did not have a right of action to compel the County to enforce its own regulations. The same day, the Executive Director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management filed his response, arguing that plaintiffs' complaint alleged only violations of federal law which did not bind him and his state agency.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, DHS and ICE filed their response. The federal agencies argued that plaintiffs' case was likely to fail because it did not challenge a final agency action, and did not show that they would suffer an irreparable harm from the detention center's construction given Supreme Court precedent that NEPA violations do not give rise to a presumption of irreparable injury.\n\nOn July 14, 2025, the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida moved to intervene as a plaintiff in the case. The Tribe noted that Big Cypress National Preserve, which included the land co-opted to build the detention center, had traditionally been part of its home and that the center's continued construction and operation would accelerate the land's environmental degradation. The court granted the Tribe's motion to intervene on July 30, 2025.\n\nTwo days later, Judge Martinez recused himself from the case. The case was automatically reassigned to Judge Kathleen M. Williams.\n\nOn July 28, 2025, the court granted in part plaintiffs' motion for expedited discovery. 2025 WL 2253243. Defendants were ordered to produce any agreements among themselves relating to Alligator Alcatraz. The next day, defendants filed a motion requesting limited reciprocal discovery from plaintiffs; that motion is still pending before the court.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, while a multi-day hearing on the preliminary injunction motion was ongoing, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' renewed motion for a limited temporary restraining order. First, it noted that it would withhold ruling on the defendants' venue challenge until the conclusion of the preliminary injunction hearing. It further rejected defendants' challenge to the court's jurisdiction, reasoning that because the plaintiffs did not seek to enjoin or restrain the operation of any immigration statute, the statute cited by the defendants to assert lack of jurisdiction was inapplicable.\u00a0 As to the TRO, the court concluded that, at minimum, the federal defendants' legal control over the facility's operations, evidence that it was constructed at the request of DHS, and regular inspections of the site by ICE officials, as well as undisputed lack of prior environmental assessment under NEPA, created a sufficient likelihood of success of the merits of the APA claim to warrant preliminary relief. Citing minimal harm to the defendants from briefly suspending expansion of the facility and the difficulty of reversing course at a later date, the court entered a temporary restraining order that prohibited the state and federal defendants from installing any additional industrial-style lighting, doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing, or doing any other site expansion including placing or erecting buildings and other structures. The TRO was to last fourteen days from the date of the order or until the court entered an order on the preliminary injunction.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, after a hearing, the court granting in part plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 242325. First, it again found that it had jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claim, which neither challenged the fact nor the manner of detention or removal, nor sought to halt, suspend, or alter operation of any INA provision, nor otherwise challenged the defendants' authority to implement or enforce immigration laws (as would preclude jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. 1252).\u00a0 Next, the court held that the defendants had waived challenge to venue in the Southern District of Florida by litigating the case on the merits for a month before raising venue issues.\u00a0 Rejecting the venue argument on the merits, it reasoned that the NEPA claim did not involve \"real property\" within the meaning of the applicable venue statute and therefore that venue was proper in the Southern District as the home of plaintiff's principal place of business, and not required to lie in the Middle District of Florida, where the facility is located.\u00a0 Moreover, a substantial portion of events that gave rise to the lawsuit took place within the Southern District, and some of the environmental concerns relevant to the NEPA claim would also affect the Southern District. Finally, the court found that the plaintiffs met the criteria for issuance of a preliminary injunction. As to a likelihood of success on the merits of plaintiffs' NEPA claims, the court noted that the defendants did not dispute the \"major\" environmental effects that would justify the need for an environmental impact statement or assessment.\u00a0 Moreover, the decision to construct the detention camp without issuing an impact statement or conducting an assessment was a definitive position that caused actual, concrete injury to the plaintiffs' recreational and conservational interests, and therefore constituted a final agency action. In addition, evidence the federal defendants requested that the facility be built and committed federal funding precluded them from disclaiming involvement or responsibility under NEPA.\u00a0 The environmental risks posed by the facility threatened irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, and the balance of equities and the public interest similarly favored granting the preliminary injunction.\n\nTherefore, the court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any person in active concert or participation with them from (1) installing any additional industrial-style lighting (so-called \u201cSunbelt\u201d lighting); or doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing; or doing any other site expansion, including placing or erecting any additional buildings, tents, dormitories, or other residential or administrative facilities on the TNT site; and (2) bringing any additional persons onto the TNT site who were not already being detained at the site at the time the order went into effect. The preliminary injunction did not prohibit modification or repairs to existing facilities that were made for the purpose of increasing safety or mitigating environmental or other risks at the site. It further ordered that after no more than sixty days, and once population attrition allowed for safe implementation, the defendants were to remove 1) the temporary fencing in order to allow tribe members access to the site consistent with the access they enjoyed before the facility was built; 2) the Sunbelt lighting fixtures and any additional lighting installed for the use of the property as a detention facility; and 3) all generators, gas, sewage, and other waste and waste receptacles that were installed for this project.\n\nThat same day, the defendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal, appealing the district court's preliminary injunction ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. On August 23, 2025, the defendants filed a district court motion to stay the injunction pending appeal and, on August 26, 2025, they filed a similar motion in the appellate court.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged Florida's and the Trump Administration's construction of an immigration detention facility dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz\" in the Everglades. The facility was built in mere days, which plaintiffs alleged circumvented or ignored regulatory and environmental standards. Designed to hold up to 5,000 noncitizens at a time, the facility was located on the grounds of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. Although the airport was located in Collier County, 36 miles west of Miami, it was owned by Miami-Dade County and operated by that county's aviation department. Miami-Dade County regulations limited the use of the site to aviation purposes. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis stated that the facility's construction was requested, and would be fully bankrolled, by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) using Federal Emergency Management Agency funds. Plaintiffs alleged violations of: the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); the Administrative Procedure Act (APA); and Miami-Dade County Code.\u00a0 They also alleged that defendants' actions were ultra vires\u00a0(i.e., in excess of their legal authority to act).\n\nPlaintiffs were two Florida-based environmental nonprofits, Friends of the Everglades and Center for Biological Diversity. On June 27, 2025, they filed this action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against DHS and its Secretary; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its Acting Director; the Florida Division of Emergency Management and its Executive Director; and Miami-Dade County. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that defendants' actions were unlawful, an injunction against the continued construction and use of the facility for non-aviation purposes including immigration detention, and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Jose E. Martinez. The same day, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction; they renewed that motion on July 17, 2025.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, Miami-Dade County filed its response. The County argued that the state of Florida had commandeered the airport under state emergency authority and that it could not use county law to restrain the state; additionally, the County contended that plaintiffs did not have a right of action to compel the County to enforce its own regulations. The same day, the Executive Director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management filed his response, arguing that plaintiffs' complaint alleged only violations of federal law which did not bind him and his state agency.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, DHS and ICE filed their response. The federal agencies argued that plaintiffs' case was likely to fail because it did not challenge a final agency action, and did not show that they would suffer an irreparable harm from the detention center's construction given Supreme Court precedent that NEPA violations do not give rise to a presumption of irreparable injury.\n\nOn July 14, 2025, the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida moved to intervene as a plaintiff in the case. The Tribe noted that Big Cypress National Preserve, which included the land co-opted to build the detention center, had traditionally been part of its home and that the center's continued construction and operation would accelerate the land's environmental degradation. The court granted the Tribe's motion to intervene on July 30, 2025.\n\nTwo days later, Judge Martinez recused himself from the case. The case was automatically reassigned to Judge Kathleen M. Williams.\n\nOn July 28, 2025, the court granted in part plaintiffs' motion for expedited discovery. 2025 WL 2253243. Defendants were ordered to produce any agreements among themselves relating to Alligator Alcatraz. The next day, defendants filed a motion requesting limited reciprocal discovery from plaintiffs; that motion is still pending before the court.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, while a multi-day hearing on the preliminary injunction motion was ongoing, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' renewed motion for a limited temporary restraining order. First, it noted that it would withhold ruling on the defendants' venue challenge until the conclusion of the preliminary injunction hearing. It further rejected defendants' challenge to the court's jurisdiction, reasoning that because the plaintiffs did not seek to enjoin or restrain the operation of any immigration statute, the statute cited by the defendants to assert lack of jurisdiction was inapplicable.\u00a0 As to the TRO, the court concluded that, at minimum, the federal defendants' legal control over the facility's operations, evidence that it was constructed at the request of DHS, and regular inspections of the site by ICE officials, as well as undisputed lack of prior environmental assessment under NEPA, created a sufficient likelihood of success of the merits of the APA claim to warrant preliminary relief. Citing minimal harm to the defendants from briefly suspending expansion of the facility and the difficulty of reversing course at a later date, the court entered a temporary restraining order that prohibited the state and federal defendants from installing any additional industrial-style lighting, doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing, or doing any other site expansion including placing or erecting buildings and other structures. The TRO was to last fourteen days from the date of the order or until the court entered an order on the preliminary injunction.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, after a hearing, the court granting in part plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 242325. First, it again found that it had jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claim, which neither challenged the fact nor the manner of detention or removal, nor sought to halt, suspend, or alter operation of any INA provision, nor otherwise challenged the defendants' authority to implement or enforce immigration laws (as would preclude jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. 1252).\u00a0 Next, the court held that the defendants had waived challenge to venue in the Southern District of Florida by litigating the case on the merits for a month before raising venue issues.\u00a0 Rejecting the venue argument on the merits, it reasoned that the NEPA claim did not involve \"real property\" within the meaning of the applicable venue statute and therefore that venue was proper in the Southern District as the home of plaintiff's principal place of business, and not required to lie in the Middle District of Florida, where the facility is located.\u00a0 Moreover, a substantial portion of events that gave rise to the lawsuit took place within the Southern District, and some of the environmental concerns relevant to the NEPA claim would also affect the Southern District. Finally, the court found that the plaintiffs met the criteria for issuance of a preliminary injunction. As to a likelihood of success on the merits of plaintiffs' NEPA claims, the court noted that the defendants did not dispute the \"major\" environmental effects that would justify the need for an environmental impact statement or assessment.\u00a0 Moreover, the decision to construct the detention camp without issuing an impact statement or conducting an assessment was a definitive position that caused actual, concrete injury to the plaintiffs' recreational and conservational interests, and therefore constituted a final agency action. In addition, evidence the federal defendants requested that the facility be built and committed federal funding precluded them from disclaiming involvement or responsibility under NEPA.\u00a0 The environmental risks posed by the facility threatened irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, and the balance of equities and the public interest similarly favored granting the preliminary injunction.\n\nTherefore, the court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any person in active concert or participation with them from (1) installing any additional industrial-style lighting (so-called \u201cSunbelt\u201d lighting); or doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing; or doing any other site expansion, including placing or erecting any additional buildings, tents, dormitories, or other residential or administrative facilities on the TNT site; and (2) bringing any additional persons onto the TNT site who were not already being detained at the site at the time the order went into effect. The preliminary injunction did not prohibit modification or repairs to existing facilities that were made for the purpose of increasing safety or mitigating environmental or other risks at the site. It further ordered that after no more than sixty days, and once population attrition allowed for safe implementation, the defendants were to remove 1) the temporary fencing in order to allow tribe members access to the site consistent with the access they enjoyed before the facility was built; 2) the Sunbelt lighting fixtures and any additional lighting installed for the use of the property as a detention facility; and 3) all generators, gas, sewage, and other waste and waste receptacles that were installed for this project.\n\nThat same day, the defendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal, appealing the district court's preliminary injunction ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. On August 23, 2025, the defendants filed a district court motion to stay the injunction pending appeal and, on August 26, 2025, they filed a similar motion in the appellate court.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged Florida's and the Trump Administration's construction of an immigration detention facility dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz\" in the Everglades. The facility was built in mere days, which plaintiffs alleged circumvented or ignored regulatory and environmental standards. Designed to hold up to 5,000 noncitizens at a time, the facility was located on the grounds of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. Although the airport was located in Collier County, 36 miles west of Miami, it was owned by Miami-Dade County and operated by that county's aviation department. Miami-Dade County regulations limited the use of the site to aviation purposes. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis stated that the facility's construction was requested, and would be fully bankrolled, by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) using Federal Emergency Management Agency funds. Plaintiffs alleged violations of: the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); the Administrative Procedure Act (APA); and Miami-Dade County Code.\u00a0 They also alleged that defendants' actions were ultra vires\u00a0(i.e., in excess of their legal authority to act).\n\nPlaintiffs were two Florida-based environmental nonprofits, Friends of the Everglades and Center for Biological Diversity. On June 27, 2025, they filed this action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against DHS and its Secretary; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its Acting Director; the Florida Division of Emergency Management and its Executive Director; and Miami-Dade County. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that defendants' actions were unlawful, an injunction against the continued construction and use of the facility for non-aviation purposes including immigration detention, and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Jose E. Martinez. The same day, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction; they renewed that motion on July 17, 2025.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, Miami-Dade County filed its response. The County argued that the state of Florida had commandeered the airport under state emergency authority and that it could not use county law to restrain the state; additionally, the County contended that plaintiffs did not have a right of action to compel the County to enforce its own regulations. The same day, the Executive Director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management filed his response, arguing that plaintiffs' complaint alleged only violations of federal law which did not bind him and his state agency.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, DHS and ICE filed their response. The federal agencies argued that plaintiffs' case was likely to fail because it did not challenge a final agency action, and did not show that they would suffer an irreparable harm from the detention center's construction given Supreme Court precedent that NEPA violations do not give rise to a presumption of irreparable injury.\n\nOn July 14, 2025, the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida moved to intervene as a plaintiff in the case. The Tribe noted that Big Cypress National Preserve, which included the land co-opted to build the detention center, had traditionally been part of its home and that the center's continued construction and operation would accelerate the land's environmental degradation. The court granted the Tribe's motion to intervene on July 30, 2025.\n\nTwo days later, Judge Martinez recused himself from the case. The case was automatically reassigned to Judge Kathleen M. Williams.\n\nOn July 28, 2025, the court granted in part plaintiffs' motion for expedited discovery. 2025 WL 2253243. Defendants were ordered to produce any agreements among themselves relating to Alligator Alcatraz. The next day, defendants filed a motion requesting limited reciprocal discovery from plaintiffs; that motion is still pending before the court.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, while a multi-day hearing on the preliminary injunction motion was ongoing, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' renewed motion for a limited temporary restraining order. First, it noted that it would withhold ruling on the defendants' venue challenge until the conclusion of the preliminary injunction hearing. It further rejected defendants' challenge to the court's jurisdiction, reasoning that because the plaintiffs did not seek to enjoin or restrain the operation of any immigration statute, the statute cited by the defendants to assert lack of jurisdiction was inapplicable.\u00a0 As to the TRO, the court concluded that, at minimum, the federal defendants' legal control over the facility's operations, evidence that it was constructed at the request of DHS, and regular inspections of the site by ICE officials, as well as undisputed lack of prior environmental assessment under NEPA, created a sufficient likelihood of success of the merits of the APA claim to warrant preliminary relief. Citing minimal harm to the defendants from briefly suspending expansion of the facility and the difficulty of reversing course at a later date, the court entered a temporary restraining order that prohibited the state and federal defendants from installing any additional industrial-style lighting, doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing, or doing any other site expansion including placing or erecting buildings and other structures. The TRO was to last fourteen days from the date of the order or until the court entered an order on the preliminary injunction.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, after a hearing, the court granting in part plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 242325. First, it again found that it had jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claim, which neither challenged the fact nor the manner of detention or removal, nor sought to halt, suspend, or alter operation of any INA provision, nor otherwise challenged the defendants' authority to implement or enforce immigration laws (as would preclude jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. 1252).\u00a0 Next, the court held that the defendants had waived challenge to venue in the Southern District of Florida by litigating the case on the merits for a month before raising venue issues.\u00a0 Rejecting the venue argument on the merits, it reasoned that the NEPA claim did not involve \"real property\" within the meaning of the applicable venue statute and therefore that venue was proper in the Southern District as the home of plaintiff's principal place of business, and not required to lie in the Middle District of Florida, where the facility is located.\u00a0 Moreover, a substantial portion of events that gave rise to the lawsuit took place within the Southern District, and some of the environmental concerns relevant to the NEPA claim would also affect the Southern District. Finally, the court found that the plaintiffs met the criteria for issuance of a preliminary injunction. As to a likelihood of success on the merits of plaintiffs' NEPA claims, the court noted that the defendants did not dispute the \"major\" environmental effects that would justify the need for an environmental impact statement or assessment.\u00a0 Moreover, the decision to construct the detention camp without issuing an impact statement or conducting an assessment was a definitive position that caused actual, concrete injury to the plaintiffs' recreational and conservational interests, and therefore constituted a final agency action. In addition, evidence the federal defendants requested that the facility be built and committed federal funding precluded them from disclaiming involvement or responsibility under NEPA.\u00a0 The environmental risks posed by the facility threatened irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, and the balance of equities and the public interest similarly favored granting the preliminary injunction.\n\nTherefore, the court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any person in active concert or participation with them from (1) installing any additional industrial-style lighting (so-called \u201cSunbelt\u201d lighting); or doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing; or doing any other site expansion, including placing or erecting any additional buildings, tents, dormitories, or other residential or administrative facilities on the TNT site; and (2) bringing any additional persons onto the TNT site who were not already being detained at the site at the time the order went into effect. The preliminary injunction did not prohibit modification or repairs to existing facilities that were made for the purpose of increasing safety or mitigating environmental or other risks at the site. It further ordered that after no more than sixty days, and once population attrition allowed for safe implementation, the defendants were to remove 1) the temporary fencing in order to allow tribe members access to the site consistent with the access they enjoyed before the facility was built; 2) the Sunbelt lighting fixtures and any additional lighting installed for the use of the property as a detention facility; and 3) all generators, gas, sewage, and other waste and waste receptacles that were installed for this project.\n\nThat same day, the defendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal, appealing the district court's preliminary injunction ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. On August 23, 2025, the defendants filed a district court motion to stay the injunction pending appeal and, on August 26, 2025, they filed a similar motion in the appellate court.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",
