    "target": "This case involves a challenge to a New York labor law prohibiting an employer from taking certain actions based on an individual or a dependent's reproductive health decision making.\n\nOn November 14, 2019, CompassCare, First Bible Baptist Church, and National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, a group of non-profit religious organizations (collectively, \u201cCompassCare\u201d) filed suit in the Northern District of New York. Represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom and private counsel, CompassCare sued the Governor of New York, the Attorney General of New York, and the Commissioner of the Labor Department of New York (collectively, \u201cNew York\u201d). CompassCare alleged that a recently passed New York Bill violated their First Amendment rights to free speech, religious association and religious expression, as well as their Fourteenth Amendment due process rights on account of being overly vague. The bill at-issue, SB 660, prohibited employers from requiring an employee to sign any sort of document purporting to require the employee to make, or not make, certain reproductive health care decisions and required employers to inform their employees of their legal rights. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was assigned to Judge Thomas J. McAvoy.\n\nOn June 5, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part CompassCare\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. It enjoined the \u201cnotice\u201d provision, that is the statutory requirement that employee handbooks include certain information regarding employee rights and remedies under the Act, and denied all other parts. In the same order, the court granted in part and denied in part New York\u2019s motion to dismiss; it denied with respect to CompassCare\u2019s free speech claims as it related to the notice provision, but granted the motion to dismiss in all other respects.\n\nOn May 21, 2021, New York and CompassCare filed cross motions for summary judgment. On March 29, 2022 the court granted CompassCare\u2019s motion for summary judgement and denied New York\u2019s. The court issued a permanent injunction barring enforcement of the statute\u2019s mandate that employee handbooks include certain information regarding employee rights and remedies under the Act. In his opinion, Judge McAvoy reasoned that this statutory requirement constituted compelled speech and was not sufficiently narrowly tailored to survive a strict scrutiny analysis.\n\nBoth parties appealed the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. On January 2, 2025 the Second Circuit issued a decision affirming the lower court\u2019s dismissal of CompassCare\u2019s free speech and free exercise claims but vacating the dismissal of CompassCare\u2019s expressive-association claims and the grant of summary judgment for CompassCare on the notice provision. The Second Circuit vacated the permanent injunction, and it vacated for further proceedings. The Second Circuit found that plaintiffs\u2019 expressive-association claim should have been analyzed under a recently decided case, Slattery v. Hochul, and so remanded for a decision consistent with Slattery. It also found that the notice provision was not unconstitutional compelled speech because it was limited to the purely factual and uncontroversial information about the State\u2019s employment laws.\n\nOn remand the case was assigned to Judge Anne M. Nardacci.\n\nOn March 26, 2025 plaintiffs filed a stipulation of dismissal which the court granted on April 2, 2025.\n\nThis case is now closed.",

    "target": "This case involves a challenge to a New York labor law prohibiting an employer from taking certain actions based on an individual or a dependent's reproductive health decision making.\n\nOn November 14, 2019, CompassCare, First Bible Baptist Church, and National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, a group of non-profit religious organizations (collectively, \u201cCompassCare\u201d) filed suit in the Northern District of New York. Represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom and private counsel, CompassCare sued the Governor of New York, the Attorney General of New York, and the Commissioner of the Labor Department of New York (collectively, \u201cNew York\u201d). CompassCare alleged that a recently passed New York Bill violated their First Amendment rights to free speech, religious association and religious expression, as well as their Fourteenth Amendment due process rights on account of being overly vague. The bill at-issue, SB 660, prohibited employers from requiring an employee to sign any sort of document purporting to require the employee to make, or not make, certain reproductive health care decisions and required employers to inform their employees of their legal rights. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was assigned to Judge Thomas J. McAvoy.\n\nOn June 5, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part CompassCare\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. It enjoined the \u201cnotice\u201d provision, that is the statutory requirement that employee handbooks include certain information regarding employee rights and remedies under the Act, and denied all other parts. In the same order, the court granted in part and denied in part New York\u2019s motion to dismiss; it denied with respect to CompassCare\u2019s free speech claims as it related to the notice provision, but granted the motion to dismiss in all other respects.\n\nOn May 21, 2021, New York and CompassCare filed cross motions for summary judgment. On March 29, 2022 the court granted CompassCare\u2019s motion for summary judgement and denied New York\u2019s. The court issued a permanent injunction barring enforcement of the statute\u2019s mandate that employee handbooks include certain information regarding employee rights and remedies under the Act. In his opinion, Judge McAvoy reasoned that this statutory requirement constituted compelled speech and was not sufficiently narrowly tailored to survive a strict scrutiny analysis.\n\nBoth parties appealed the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. On January 2, 2025 the Second Circuit issued a decision affirming the lower court\u2019s dismissal of CompassCare\u2019s free speech and free exercise claims but vacating the dismissal of CompassCare\u2019s expressive-association claims and the grant of summary judgment for CompassCare on the notice provision. The Second Circuit vacated the permanent injunction, and it vacated for further proceedings. The Second Circuit found that plaintiffs\u2019 expressive-association claim should have been analyzed under a recently decided case, Slattery v. Hochul, and so remanded for a decision consistent with Slattery. It also found that the notice provision was not unconstitutional compelled speech because it was limited to the purely factual and uncontroversial information about the State\u2019s employment laws.\n\nOn remand the case was assigned to Judge Anne M. Nardacci.\n\nOn March 26, 2025 plaintiffs filed a stipulation of dismissal which the court granted on April 2, 2025.\n\nThis case is now closed.",

    "target": "This case involves a challenge to a New York labor law prohibiting an employer from taking certain actions based on an individual or a dependent's reproductive health decision making.\n\nOn November 14, 2019, CompassCare, First Bible Baptist Church, and National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, a group of non-profit religious organizations (collectively, \u201cCompassCare\u201d) filed suit in the Northern District of New York. Represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom and private counsel, CompassCare sued the Governor of New York, the Attorney General of New York, and the Commissioner of the Labor Department of New York (collectively, \u201cNew York\u201d). CompassCare alleged that a recently passed New York Bill violated their First Amendment rights to free speech, religious association and religious expression, as well as their Fourteenth Amendment due process rights on account of being overly vague. The bill at-issue, SB 660, prohibited employers from requiring an employee to sign any sort of document purporting to require the employee to make, or not make, certain reproductive health care decisions and required employers to inform their employees of their legal rights. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was assigned to Judge Thomas J. McAvoy.\n\nOn June 5, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part CompassCare\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. It enjoined the \u201cnotice\u201d provision, that is the statutory requirement that employee handbooks include certain information regarding employee rights and remedies under the Act, and denied all other parts. In the same order, the court granted in part and denied in part New York\u2019s motion to dismiss; it denied with respect to CompassCare\u2019s free speech claims as it related to the notice provision, but granted the motion to dismiss in all other respects.\n\nOn May 21, 2021, New York and CompassCare filed cross motions for summary judgment. On March 29, 2022 the court granted CompassCare\u2019s motion for summary judgement and denied New York\u2019s. The court issued a permanent injunction barring enforcement of the statute\u2019s mandate that employee handbooks include certain information regarding employee rights and remedies under the Act. In his opinion, Judge McAvoy reasoned that this statutory requirement constituted compelled speech and was not sufficiently narrowly tailored to survive a strict scrutiny analysis.\n\nBoth parties appealed the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. On January 2, 2025 the Second Circuit issued a decision affirming the lower court\u2019s dismissal of CompassCare\u2019s free speech and free exercise claims but vacating the dismissal of CompassCare\u2019s expressive-association claims and the grant of summary judgment for CompassCare on the notice provision. The Second Circuit vacated the permanent injunction, and it vacated for further proceedings. The Second Circuit found that plaintiffs\u2019 expressive-association claim should have been analyzed under a recently decided case, Slattery v. Hochul, and so remanded for a decision consistent with Slattery. It also found that the notice provision was not unconstitutional compelled speech because it was limited to the purely factual and uncontroversial information about the State\u2019s employment laws.\n\nOn remand the case was assigned to Judge Anne M. Nardacci.\n\nOn March 26, 2025 plaintiffs filed a stipulation of dismissal which the court granted on April 2, 2025.\n\nThis case is now closed.",

    "target": "This case involves a challenge to a New York labor law prohibiting an employer from taking certain actions based on an individual or a dependent's reproductive health decision making.\n\nOn November 14, 2019, CompassCare, First Bible Baptist Church, and National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, a group of non-profit religious organizations (collectively, \u201cCompassCare\u201d) filed suit in the Northern District of New York. Represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom and private counsel, CompassCare sued the Governor of New York, the Attorney General of New York, and the Commissioner of the Labor Department of New York (collectively, \u201cNew York\u201d). CompassCare alleged that a recently passed New York Bill violated their First Amendment rights to free speech, religious association and religious expression, as well as their Fourteenth Amendment due process rights on account of being overly vague. The bill at-issue, SB 660, prohibited employers from requiring an employee to sign any sort of document purporting to require the employee to make, or not make, certain reproductive health care decisions and required employers to inform their employees of their legal rights. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was assigned to Judge Thomas J. McAvoy.\n\nOn June 5, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part CompassCare\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. It enjoined the \u201cnotice\u201d provision, that is the statutory requirement that employee handbooks include certain information regarding employee rights and remedies under the Act, and denied all other parts. In the same order, the court granted in part and denied in part New York\u2019s motion to dismiss; it denied with respect to CompassCare\u2019s free speech claims as it related to the notice provision, but granted the motion to dismiss in all other respects.\n\nOn May 21, 2021, New York and CompassCare filed cross motions for summary judgment. On March 29, 2022 the court granted CompassCare\u2019s motion for summary judgement and denied New York\u2019s. The court issued a permanent injunction barring enforcement of the statute\u2019s mandate that employee handbooks include certain information regarding employee rights and remedies under the Act. In his opinion, Judge McAvoy reasoned that this statutory requirement constituted compelled speech and was not sufficiently narrowly tailored to survive a strict scrutiny analysis.\n\nBoth parties appealed the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. On January 2, 2025 the Second Circuit issued a decision affirming the lower court\u2019s dismissal of CompassCare\u2019s free speech and free exercise claims but vacating the dismissal of CompassCare\u2019s expressive-association claims and the grant of summary judgment for CompassCare on the notice provision. The Second Circuit vacated the permanent injunction, and it vacated for further proceedings. The Second Circuit found that plaintiffs\u2019 expressive-association claim should have been analyzed under a recently decided case, Slattery v. Hochul, and so remanded for a decision consistent with Slattery. It also found that the notice provision was not unconstitutional compelled speech because it was limited to the purely factual and uncontroversial information about the State\u2019s employment laws.\n\nOn remand the case was assigned to Judge Anne M. Nardacci.\n\nOn March 26, 2025 plaintiffs filed a stipulation of dismissal which the court granted on April 2, 2025.\n\nThis case is now closed.",
