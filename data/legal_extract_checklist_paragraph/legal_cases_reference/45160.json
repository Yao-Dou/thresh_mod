Washington state authorities reached an agreement to remove the durational residency requirement.\n\nOn the November 7, 2023 complaint (as amended on November 20, 2023), the Washington State Alliance for Retired Americans sued (i) Steve Hobbs in his official capacity as Washington Secretary of State, (ii) Mary Hall in her official capacity as Thurston County Auditor, and (iii) Julie Wise in her official capacity as King County Elections Director, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, alleging that the Washington State DRR violates the Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution's First and Fourteenth Amendments because the DRR prohibits any voter who has moved into or within the state within 30 days of an election from registering and voting at their address.\n\nOn March 15, 2024, the parties entered into a Consent Judgment and Decree, pursuant to which the Defendants agreed with the Alliance\u2019s claims that the state\u2019s 30-day pre-election durational residency requirement imposed on registrants and voters violates Section 202(c) of the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970 (\u201cVRA\u201d), 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502(c), and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Const. amends.

In their motion, Beaton and Walsh argued primarily that they should be allowed to intervene based on their allegations that the underlying litigation was collusive and that Defendants failed to advance potentially meritorious arguments challenging Plaintiff\u2019s Article III standing.\n\nOn October 11, 2024, the Court denied the motion to intervene as defendants in the case from Beaton and Walsh as they have not met their burden to show that they timely moved to intervene.",

Washington state authorities reached an agreement to remove the durational residency requirement.\n\nOn the November 7, 2023 complaint (as amended on November 20, 2023), the Washington State Alliance for Retired Americans sued (i) Steve Hobbs in his official capacity as Washington Secretary of State, (ii) Mary Hall in her official capacity as Thurston County Auditor, and (iii) Julie Wise in her official capacity as King County Elections Director, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, alleging that the Washington State DRR violates the Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution's First and Fourteenth Amendments because the DRR prohibits any voter who has moved into or within the state within 30 days of an election from registering and voting at their address.\n\nOn March 15, 2024, the parties entered into a Consent Judgment and Decree, pursuant to which the Defendants agreed with the Alliance\u2019s claims that the state\u2019s 30-day pre-election durational residency requirement imposed on registrants and voters violates Section 202(c) of the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970 (\u201cVRA\u201d), 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502(c), and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Const. amends.
