You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 12, 2025, two Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus and a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State, and the Denver Contract Detention Facility, the Colorado ICE facility where the petitioners are being held.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the ACLU of Colorado, and the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, the petitioners challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Charlotte Sweeney.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. On April 14, the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the District of Colorado while the case proceeded. The court also set a briefing schedule for the TRO motion and scheduled a hearing for April 21.\n\nJudge Sweeney issued another 14-day TRO following the April 21 hearing, prohibiting the respondents from removing petitioners and class members from the District of Colorado and requiring respondents to give petitioners and class members a 21-day notice if the government sought to detain them pursuant to the AEA. The order also directed petitioner to file any motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) within three days. The court also ordered respondents to respond to the motion for class certification by April 28, with petitioner's reply due by May 2.\n\nRespondents appealed the TRO to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on April 23 (USCA case no. 25-1164). In the district court, respondents filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, which Judge Sweeney denied on April 24. The same day, the respondent-appellants also filed an emergency stay motion pending appeal in the Tenth Circuit, which ordered petitioner-appellee to respond by April 26, with any reply due by April 27. The Court of Appeals denied the emergency stay motion on April 29, finding that the government had not made the required irreparable-injury showing.\n\nThe petitioner filed a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) on April 25. The respondents filed their response five days later, and petitioner filed his response on May 2.\n\nBriefing on the class certification motion took place according to the court's schedule included in its order granting the TRO, concluding on May 2.\n\nOn May 6, Judge Sweeney certified a class of \"All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua' and/or its implementation.\"\n\nJudge Sweeney examined closely each of the requirements for certifying a class, holding most importantly that the class members' risk of deportation under the Proclamation provided the required commonality. She rejected arguments that differences in other parts of class members' cases should prevent certification. She also certified the class under Rule 23(b)(2) finding that the proposed class was \u201csufficiently cohesive,\u201d and that the injunctive relief the petitioners sought \u201cwould benefit them as well as all members of the proposed class in the same fashion.\u201d\n\nJudge Sweeney also entered a preliminary injunction ordering the government not to detain, transfer, or remove petitioners and members of the certified class from the District of Colorado.\n\nJudge Sweeney found that petitioners were likely to succeed on the merits because a \u201cinvasion\u201d under the AEA demands military action by a foreign nation government.\u00a0 She held that the Proclamation fails to adequately find or assert TdA was a foreign nation or government. Judge Sweeney accepted the petitioners' allegations that they faced the risk of irreparable harm in part because of the detention conditions in El Salvador\u2019s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).\u00a0 In balancing the equities and public interest, Judge Sweeney found that the public interest in preventing wrongful removals\u2014particularly where those removals exposed Petitioners and class members to harmful conditions\u2014outweighed any harm to the government, partly because any such harm was mitigated by the government's availability to prosecute and remove noncitizens under Title 8,\n\nIn reaching this decision, Judge Sweeney rejected the government's argument that the petitioners lack standing because they were not at the time of the hearing designated as falling under the Proclamation. Judge Sweeney concluded \u201cthere is a\u00a0 substantial risk that the harm of being subject to the Proclamation will arise\u2014despite [Petitioners\u2019] current designation as individuals who do not fall under it.\u201d\n\nJudge Sweeney also rejected respondents' broad challenges to jurisdiction on the basis that the petition constituted an unconstitutional challenge to presidential power, the political question doctrine, and several other broad attacks on the court's jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 7, the government appealed the injunction and class certification to the U.S. Circuit Court for the Tenth Circuit (Case No. 25-1265).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This is one of several class action challenges to the Trump Administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act (\"AEA\") to circumvent removal procedures and deport Venezuelan nationals without due process. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 12, 2025, two Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus and a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State, and the Denver Contract Detention Facility, the Colorado ICE facility where the petitioners are being held.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the ACLU of Colorado, and the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, the petitioners challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Charlotte Sweeney.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. On April 14, the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the District of Colorado while the case proceeded. The court also set a briefing schedule for the TRO motion and scheduled a hearing for April 21.\n\nJudge Sweeney issued another 14-day TRO following the April 21 hearing, prohibiting the respondents from removing petitioners and class members from the District of Colorado and requiring respondents to give petitioners and class members a 21-day notice if the government sought to detain them pursuant to the AEA. The order also directed petitioner to file any motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) within three days. The court also ordered respondents to respond to the motion for class certification by April 28, with petitioner's reply due by May 2.\n\nRespondents appealed the TRO to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on April 23 (USCA case no. 25-1164). In the district court, respondents filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, which Judge Sweeney denied on April 24. The same day, the respondent-appellants also filed an emergency stay motion pending appeal in the Tenth Circuit, which ordered petitioner-appellee to respond by April 26, with any reply due by April 27. The Court of Appeals denied the emergency stay motion on April 29, finding that the government had not made the required irreparable-injury showing.\n\nThe petitioner filed a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) on April 25. The respondents filed their response five days later, and petitioner filed his response on May 2.\n\nBriefing on the class certification motion took place according to the court's schedule included in its order granting the TRO, concluding on May 2.\n\nOn May 6, Judge Sweeney certified a class of \"All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua' and/or its implementation.\"\n\nJudge Sweeney examined closely each of the requirements for certifying a class, holding most importantly that the class members' risk of deportation under the Proclamation provided the required commonality. She rejected arguments that differences in other parts of class members' cases should prevent certification. She also certified the class under Rule 23(b)(2) finding that the proposed class was \u201csufficiently cohesive,\u201d and that the injunctive relief the petitioners sought \u201cwould benefit them as well as all members of the proposed class in the same fashion.\u201d\n\nJudge Sweeney also entered a preliminary injunction ordering the government not to detain, transfer, or remove petitioners and members of the certified class from the District of Colorado.\n\nJudge Sweeney found that petitioners were likely to succeed on the merits because a \u201cinvasion\u201d under the AEA demands military action by a foreign nation government.\u00a0 She held that the Proclamation fails to adequately find or assert TdA was a foreign nation or government. Judge Sweeney accepted the petitioners' allegations that they faced the risk of irreparable harm in part because of the detention conditions in El Salvador\u2019s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).\u00a0 In balancing the equities and public interest, Judge Sweeney found that the public interest in preventing wrongful removals\u2014particularly where those removals exposed Petitioners and class members to harmful conditions\u2014outweighed any harm to the government, partly because any such harm was mitigated by the government's availability to prosecute and remove noncitizens under Title 8,\n\nIn reaching this decision, Judge Sweeney rejected the government's argument that the petitioners lack standing because they were not at the time of the hearing designated as falling under the Proclamation. Judge Sweeney concluded \u201cthere is a\u00a0 substantial risk that the harm of being subject to the Proclamation will arise\u2014despite [Petitioners\u2019] current designation as individuals who do not fall under it.\u201d\n\nJudge Sweeney also rejected respondents' broad challenges to jurisdiction on the basis that the petition constituted an unconstitutional challenge to presidential power, the political question doctrine, and several other broad attacks on the court's jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 7, the government appealed the injunction and class certification to the U.S. Circuit Court for the Tenth Circuit (Case No. 25-1265).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 12, 2025, two Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus and a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State, and the Denver Contract Detention Facility, the Colorado ICE facility where the petitioners are being held.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the ACLU of Colorado, and the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, the petitioners challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Charlotte Sweeney.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. On April 14, the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the District of Colorado while the case proceeded. The court also set a briefing schedule for the TRO motion and scheduled a hearing for April 21.\n\nJudge Sweeney issued another 14-day TRO following the April 21 hearing, prohibiting the respondents from removing petitioners and class members from the District of Colorado and requiring respondents to give petitioners and class members a 21-day notice if the government sought to detain them pursuant to the AEA. The order also directed petitioner to file any motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) within three days. The court also ordered respondents to respond to the motion for class certification by April 28, with petitioner's reply due by May 2.\n\nRespondents appealed the TRO to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on April 23 (USCA case no. 25-1164). In the district court, respondents filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, which Judge Sweeney denied on April 24. The same day, the respondent-appellants also filed an emergency stay motion pending appeal in the Tenth Circuit, which ordered petitioner-appellee to respond by April 26, with any reply due by April 27. The Court of Appeals denied the emergency stay motion on April 29, finding that the government had not made the required irreparable-injury showing.\n\nThe petitioner filed a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) on April 25. The respondents filed their response five days later, and petitioner filed his response on May 2.\n\nBriefing on the class certification motion took place according to the court's schedule included in its order granting the TRO, concluding on May 2.\n\nOn May 6, Judge Sweeney certified a class of \"All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua' and/or its implementation.\"\n\nJudge Sweeney examined closely each of the requirements for certifying a class, holding most importantly that the class members' risk of deportation under the Proclamation provided the required commonality. She rejected arguments that differences in other parts of class members' cases should prevent certification. She also certified the class under Rule 23(b)(2) finding that the proposed class was \u201csufficiently cohesive,\u201d and that the injunctive relief the petitioners sought \u201cwould benefit them as well as all members of the proposed class in the same fashion.\u201d\n\nJudge Sweeney also entered a preliminary injunction ordering the government not to detain, transfer, or remove petitioners and members of the certified class from the District of Colorado.\n\nJudge Sweeney found that petitioners were likely to succeed on the merits because a \u201cinvasion\u201d under the AEA demands military action by a foreign nation government.\u00a0 She held that the Proclamation fails to adequately find or assert TdA was a foreign nation or government. Judge Sweeney accepted the petitioners' allegations that they faced the risk of irreparable harm in part because of the detention conditions in El Salvador\u2019s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).\u00a0 In balancing the equities and public interest, Judge Sweeney found that the public interest in preventing wrongful removals\u2014particularly where those removals exposed Petitioners and class members to harmful conditions\u2014outweighed any harm to the government, partly because any such harm was mitigated by the government's availability to prosecute and remove noncitizens under Title 8,\n\nIn reaching this decision, Judge Sweeney rejected the government's argument that the petitioners lack standing because they were not at the time of the hearing designated as falling under the Proclamation. Judge Sweeney concluded \u201cthere is a\u00a0 substantial risk that the harm of being subject to the Proclamation will arise\u2014despite [Petitioners\u2019] current designation as individuals who do not fall under it.\u201d\n\nJudge Sweeney also rejected respondents' broad challenges to jurisdiction on the basis that the petition constituted an unconstitutional challenge to presidential power, the political question doctrine, and several other broad attacks on the court's jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 7, the government appealed the injunction and class certification to the U.S. Circuit Court for the Tenth Circuit (Case No. 25-1265).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State, and the Denver Contract Detention Facility, the Colorado ICE facility where the petitioners are being held.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the ACLU of Colorado, and the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, the petitioners challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Charlotte Sweeney.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. On April 14, the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the District of Colorado while the case proceeded. The court also set a briefing schedule for the TRO motion and scheduled a hearing for April 21.\n\nJudge Sweeney issued another 14-day TRO following the April 21 hearing, prohibiting the respondents from removing petitioners and class members from the District of Colorado and requiring respondents to give petitioners and class members a 21-day notice if the government sought to detain them pursuant to the AEA. The order also directed petitioner to file any motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) within three days. The court also ordered respondents to respond to the motion for class certification by April 28, with petitioner's reply due by May 2.\n\nRespondents appealed the TRO to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on April 23 (USCA case no. 25-1164). In the district court, respondents filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, which Judge Sweeney denied on April 24. The same day, the respondent-appellants also filed an emergency stay motion pending appeal in the Tenth Circuit, which ordered petitioner-appellee to respond by April 26, with any reply due by April 27. The Court of Appeals denied the emergency stay motion on April 29, finding that the government had not made the required irreparable-injury showing.\n\nThe petitioner filed a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) on April 25. The respondents filed their response five days later, and petitioner filed his response on May 2.\n\nBriefing on the class certification motion took place according to the court's schedule included in its order granting the TRO, concluding on May 2.\n\nOn May 6, Judge Sweeney certified a class of \"All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua' and/or its implementation.\"\n\nJudge Sweeney examined closely each of the requirements for certifying a class, holding most importantly that the class members' risk of deportation under the Proclamation provided the required commonality. She rejected arguments that differences in other parts of class members' cases should prevent certification. She also certified the class under Rule 23(b)(2) finding that the proposed class was \u201csufficiently cohesive,\u201d and that the injunctive relief the petitioners sought \u201cwould benefit them as well as all members of the proposed class in the same fashion.\u201d\n\nJudge Sweeney also entered a preliminary injunction ordering the government not to detain, transfer, or remove petitioners and members of the certified class from the District of Colorado.\n\nJudge Sweeney found that petitioners were likely to succeed on the merits because a \u201cinvasion\u201d under the AEA demands military action by a foreign nation government.\u00a0 She held that the Proclamation fails to adequately find or assert TdA was a foreign nation or government. Judge Sweeney accepted the petitioners' allegations that they faced the risk of irreparable harm in part because of the detention conditions in El Salvador\u2019s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).\u00a0 In balancing the equities and public interest, Judge Sweeney found that the public interest in preventing wrongful removals\u2014particularly where those removals exposed Petitioners and class members to harmful conditions\u2014outweighed any harm to the government, partly because any such harm was mitigated by the government's availability to prosecute and remove noncitizens under Title 8,\n\nIn reaching this decision, Judge Sweeney rejected the government's argument that the petitioners lack standing because they were not at the time of the hearing designated as falling under the Proclamation. Judge Sweeney concluded \u201cthere is a\u00a0 substantial risk that the harm of being subject to the Proclamation will arise\u2014despite [Petitioners\u2019] current designation as individuals who do not fall under it.\u201d\n\nJudge Sweeney also rejected respondents' broad challenges to jurisdiction on the basis that the petition constituted an unconstitutional challenge to presidential power, the political question doctrine, and several other broad attacks on the court's jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 7, the government appealed the injunction and class certification to the U.S. Circuit Court for the Tenth Circuit (Case No. 25-1265).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This is one of several class action challenges to the Trump Administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act (\"AEA\") to circumvent removal procedures and deport Venezuelan nationals without due process. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 12, 2025, two Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus and a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State, and the Denver Contract Detention Facility, the Colorado ICE facility where the petitioners are being held.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the ACLU of Colorado, and the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, the petitioners challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Charlotte Sweeney.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. On April 14, the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the District of Colorado while the case proceeded. The court also set a briefing schedule for the TRO motion and scheduled a hearing for April 21.\n\nJudge Sweeney issued another 14-day TRO following the April 21 hearing, prohibiting the respondents from removing petitioners and class members from the District of Colorado and requiring respondents to give petitioners and class members a 21-day notice if the government sought to detain them pursuant to the AEA. The order also directed petitioner to file any motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) within three days. The court also ordered respondents to respond to the motion for class certification by April 28, with petitioner's reply due by May 2.\n\nRespondents appealed the TRO to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on April 23 (USCA case no. 25-1164). In the district court, respondents filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, which Judge Sweeney denied on April 24. The same day, the respondent-appellants also filed an emergency stay motion pending appeal in the Tenth Circuit, which ordered petitioner-appellee to respond by April 26, with any reply due by April 27. The Court of Appeals denied the emergency stay motion on April 29, finding that the government had not made the required irreparable-injury showing.\n\nThe petitioner filed a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) on April 25. The respondents filed their response five days later, and petitioner filed his response on May 2.\n\nBriefing on the class certification motion took place according to the court's schedule included in its order granting the TRO, concluding on May 2.\n\nOn May 6, Judge Sweeney certified a class of \"All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua' and/or its implementation.\"\n\nJudge Sweeney examined closely each of the requirements for certifying a class, holding most importantly that the class members' risk of deportation under the Proclamation provided the required commonality. She rejected arguments that differences in other parts of class members' cases should prevent certification. She also certified the class under Rule 23(b)(2) finding that the proposed class was \u201csufficiently cohesive,\u201d and that the injunctive relief the petitioners sought \u201cwould benefit them as well as all members of the proposed class in the same fashion.\u201d\n\nJudge Sweeney also entered a preliminary injunction ordering the government not to detain, transfer, or remove petitioners and members of the certified class from the District of Colorado.\n\nJudge Sweeney found that petitioners were likely to succeed on the merits because a \u201cinvasion\u201d under the AEA demands military action by a foreign nation government.\u00a0 She held that the Proclamation fails to adequately find or assert TdA was a foreign nation or government. Judge Sweeney accepted the petitioners' allegations that they faced the risk of irreparable harm in part because of the detention conditions in El Salvador\u2019s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).\u00a0 In balancing the equities and public interest, Judge Sweeney found that the public interest in preventing wrongful removals\u2014particularly where those removals exposed Petitioners and class members to harmful conditions\u2014outweighed any harm to the government, partly because any such harm was mitigated by the government's availability to prosecute and remove noncitizens under Title 8,\n\nIn reaching this decision, Judge Sweeney rejected the government's argument that the petitioners lack standing because they were not at the time of the hearing designated as falling under the Proclamation. Judge Sweeney concluded \u201cthere is a\u00a0 substantial risk that the harm of being subject to the Proclamation will arise\u2014despite [Petitioners\u2019] current designation as individuals who do not fall under it.\u201d\n\nJudge Sweeney also rejected respondents' broad challenges to jurisdiction on the basis that the petition constituted an unconstitutional challenge to presidential power, the political question doctrine, and several other broad attacks on the court's jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 7, the government appealed the injunction and class certification to the U.S. Circuit Court for the Tenth Circuit (Case No. 25-1265).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This is one of several class action challenges to the Trump Administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act (\"AEA\") to circumvent removal procedures and deport Venezuelan nationals without due process. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 12, 2025, two Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus and a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State, and the Denver Contract Detention Facility, the Colorado ICE facility where the petitioners are being held.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the ACLU of Colorado, and the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, the petitioners challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Charlotte Sweeney.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. On April 14, the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the District of Colorado while the case proceeded. The court also set a briefing schedule for the TRO motion and scheduled a hearing for April 21.\n\nJudge Sweeney issued another 14-day TRO following the April 21 hearing, prohibiting the respondents from removing petitioners and class members from the District of Colorado and requiring respondents to give petitioners and class members a 21-day notice if the government sought to detain them pursuant to the AEA. The order also directed petitioner to file any motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) within three days. The court also ordered respondents to respond to the motion for class certification by April 28, with petitioner's reply due by May 2.\n\nRespondents appealed the TRO to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on April 23 (USCA case no. 25-1164). In the district court, respondents filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, which Judge Sweeney denied on April 24. The same day, the respondent-appellants also filed an emergency stay motion pending appeal in the Tenth Circuit, which ordered petitioner-appellee to respond by April 26, with any reply due by April 27. The Court of Appeals denied the emergency stay motion on April 29, finding that the government had not made the required irreparable-injury showing.\n\nThe petitioner filed a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) on April 25. The respondents filed their response five days later, and petitioner filed his response on May 2.\n\nBriefing on the class certification motion took place according to the court's schedule included in its order granting the TRO, concluding on May 2.\n\nOn May 6, Judge Sweeney certified a class of \"All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua' and/or its implementation.\"\n\nJudge Sweeney examined closely each of the requirements for certifying a class, holding most importantly that the class members' risk of deportation under the Proclamation provided the required commonality. She rejected arguments that differences in other parts of class members' cases should prevent certification. She also certified the class under Rule 23(b)(2) finding that the proposed class was \u201csufficiently cohesive,\u201d and that the injunctive relief the petitioners sought \u201cwould benefit them as well as all members of the proposed class in the same fashion.\u201d\n\nJudge Sweeney also entered a preliminary injunction ordering the government not to detain, transfer, or remove petitioners and members of the certified class from the District of Colorado.\n\nJudge Sweeney found that petitioners were likely to succeed on the merits because a \u201cinvasion\u201d under the AEA demands military action by a foreign nation government.\u00a0 She held that the Proclamation fails to adequately find or assert TdA was a foreign nation or government.

The respondents filed their response five days later, and petitioner filed his response on May 2.\n\nBriefing on the class certification motion took place according to the court's schedule included in its order granting the TRO, concluding on May 2.\n\nOn May 6, Judge Sweeney certified a class of \"All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua' and/or its implementation.\"\n\nJudge Sweeney examined closely each of the requirements for certifying a class, holding most importantly that the class members' risk of deportation under the Proclamation provided the required commonality. She rejected arguments that differences in other parts of class members' cases should prevent certification. She also certified the class under Rule 23(b)(2) finding that the proposed class was \u201csufficiently cohesive,\u201d and that the injunctive relief the petitioners sought \u201cwould benefit them as well as all members of the proposed class in the same fashion.\u201d\n\nJudge Sweeney also entered a preliminary injunction ordering the government not to detain, transfer, or remove petitioners and members of the certified class from the District of Colorado.\n\nJudge Sweeney found that petitioners were likely to succeed on the merits because a \u201cinvasion\u201d under the AEA demands military action by a foreign nation government.\u00a0 She held that the Proclamation fails to adequately find or assert TdA was a foreign nation or government. Judge Sweeney accepted the petitioners' allegations that they faced the risk of irreparable harm in part because of the detention conditions in El Salvador\u2019s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).\u00a0 In balancing the equities and public interest, Judge Sweeney found that the public interest in preventing wrongful removals\u2014particularly where those removals exposed Petitioners and class members to harmful conditions\u2014outweighed any harm to the government, partly because any such harm was mitigated by the government's availability to prosecute and remove noncitizens under Title 8,\n\nIn reaching this decision, Judge Sweeney rejected the government's argument that the petitioners lack standing because they were not at the time of the hearing designated as falling under the Proclamation. Judge Sweeney concluded \u201cthere is a\u00a0 substantial risk that the harm of being subject to the Proclamation will arise\u2014despite [Petitioners\u2019] current designation as individuals who do not fall under it.\u201d\n\nJudge Sweeney also rejected respondents' broad challenges to jurisdiction on the basis that the petition constituted an unconstitutional challenge to presidential power, the political question doctrine, and several other broad attacks on the court's jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 7, the government appealed the injunction and class certification to the U.S. Circuit Court for the Tenth Circuit (Case No. 25-1265).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 12, 2025, two Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus and a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State, and the Denver Contract Detention Facility, the Colorado ICE facility where the petitioners are being held.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the ACLU of Colorado, and the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, the petitioners challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Charlotte Sweeney.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. On April 14, the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the District of Colorado while the case proceeded. The court also set a briefing schedule for the TRO motion and scheduled a hearing for April 21.\n\nJudge Sweeney issued another 14-day TRO following the April 21 hearing, prohibiting the respondents from removing petitioners and class members from the District of Colorado and requiring respondents to give petitioners and class members a 21-day notice if the government sought to detain them pursuant to the AEA. The order also directed petitioner to file any motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) within three days.

    "target": "This is one of several class action challenges to the Trump Administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act (\"AEA\") to circumvent removal procedures and deport Venezuelan nationals without due process. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 12, 2025, two Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus and a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), the Department of State, and the Denver Contract Detention Facility, the Colorado ICE facility where the petitioners are being held.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the ACLU of Colorado, and the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, the petitioners challenged the Administration\u2019s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Charlotte Sweeney.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. On April 14, the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the District of Colorado while the case proceeded. The court also set a briefing schedule for the TRO motion and scheduled a hearing for April 21.\n\nJudge Sweeney issued another 14-day TRO following the April 21 hearing, prohibiting the respondents from removing petitioners and class members from the District of Colorado and requiring respondents to give petitioners and class members a 21-day notice if the government sought to detain them pursuant to the AEA. The order also directed petitioner to file any motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) within three days. The court also ordered respondents to respond to the motion for class certification by April 28, with petitioner's reply due by May 2.\n\nRespondents appealed the TRO to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on April 23 (USCA case no. 25-1164). In the district court, respondents filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, which Judge Sweeney denied on April 24. The same day, the respondent-appellants also filed an emergency stay motion pending appeal in the Tenth Circuit, which ordered petitioner-appellee to respond by April 26, with any reply due by April 27. The Court of Appeals denied the emergency stay motion on April 29, finding that the government had not made the required irreparable-injury showing.\n\nThe petitioner filed a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) on April 25. The respondents filed their response five days later, and petitioner filed his response on May 2.\n\nBriefing on the class certification motion took place according to the court's schedule included in its order granting the TRO, concluding on May 2.\n\nOn May 6, Judge Sweeney certified a class of \"All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua' and/or its implementation.\"\n\nJudge Sweeney examined closely each of the requirements for certifying a class, holding most importantly that the class members' risk of deportation under the Proclamation provided the required commonality. She rejected arguments that differences in other parts of class members' cases should prevent certification. She also certified the class under Rule 23(b)(2) finding that the proposed class was \u201csufficiently cohesive,\u201d and that the injunctive relief the petitioners sought \u201cwould benefit them as well as all members of the proposed class in the same fashion.\u201d\n\nJudge Sweeney also entered a preliminary injunction ordering the government not to detain, transfer, or remove petitioners and members of the certified class from the District of Colorado.\n\nJudge Sweeney found that petitioners were likely to succeed on the merits because a \u201cinvasion\u201d under the AEA demands military action by a foreign nation government.\u00a0 She held that the Proclamation fails to adequately find or assert TdA was a foreign nation or government. Judge Sweeney accepted the petitioners' allegations that they faced the risk of irreparable harm in part because of the detention conditions in El Salvador\u2019s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).\u00a0 In balancing the equities and public interest, Judge Sweeney found that the public interest in preventing wrongful removals\u2014particularly where those removals exposed Petitioners and class members to harmful conditions\u2014outweighed any harm to the government, partly because any such harm was mitigated by the government's availability to prosecute and remove noncitizens under Title 8,\n\nIn reaching this decision, Judge Sweeney rejected the government's argument that the petitioners lack standing because they were not at the time of the hearing designated as falling under the Proclamation. Judge Sweeney concluded \u201cthere is a\u00a0 substantial risk that the harm of being subject to the Proclamation will arise\u2014despite [Petitioners\u2019] current designation as individuals who do not fall under it.\u201d\n\nJudge Sweeney also rejected respondents' broad challenges to jurisdiction on the basis that the petition constituted an unconstitutional challenge to presidential power, the political question doctrine, and several other broad attacks on the court's jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 7, the government appealed the injunction and class certification to the U.S. Circuit Court for the Tenth Circuit (Case No. 25-1265).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",
