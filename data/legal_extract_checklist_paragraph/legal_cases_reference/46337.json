    "target": "This case challenged Executive Order 14248, which imposed various requirements on federal elections. On April 3, 2025, nineteen states filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, naming President Donald Trump, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and its director and commissioners, and the Secretary of Defense as Defendants. They challenged multiple sections of Executive Order 14248, titled \"Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,\" signed on March 25, 2025. These sections:\n\n\u2022 Require the EAC to demand documentary proof of citizenship and to record such information,   \u2022 Require the heads of federal voter registration agencies to assess citizenship prior to providing registration forms,   \u2022 Order the Secretary of Defense to require proof of citizenship in the Federal Post Card Application,   \u2022 Command the Attorney General to take action against states that count absentee ballots received after Election Day, and   \u2022 Condition federal funding upon compliance with the EO.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that by purporting to impose election rules on the states, the President exceeded his constitutional powers and unlawfully infringed on congressional and state authority, thereby violating the Separation of Powers, the Administrative Procedure Act, the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), and the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA). Represented by their respective attorneys general, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorney fees. The case was assigned to District Judge Denise J. Casper.\n\nOn April 23, the defendants moved to transfer and consolidate this case with a case in the District Court for the District of Columbia, League of United Latin American Citizens v. Executive Office of the President [../../../../case/46322/], which also challenged the EO. Judge Casper denied the motion on May 9, finding that transfer was not in the interests of justice in this case, given that the plaintiffs here were states, not private parties, and this case challenged different sections of the EO from those challenged in the D.D.C. case.\n\nOn May 5, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. The court granted the motion on June 13, finding that the challenged sections were ripe for review since they either imposed deadlines or clearly laid out actions that the defendants were required to take. Turning to the merits, the court found that the President lacked the authority to take the actions challenged, since in federal statutes such as the NVRA, the HAVA, and the UOCAVA, Congress set requirements for federal elections that did not include those required by the EO. Finally, the court found that Congress had never endorsed the EO's interpretation regarding absentee and mail-in ballots in its various Election Day statutes and that the EO could not impose conditions on formula grants since the Constitution \"vests exclusive power in Congress to impose conditions on federal grants.\" Therefore, the court enjoined the defendants from implementing any of the challenged sections of the EO. 2025 WL 1667949.\n\nAlso on June 13, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs either lacked standing (since they were challenging actions that allegedly did not affect them) or were bringing claims that were not ripe (since they were bringing claims challenging actions that had not yet occurred, and which still need to go through additional legal and policy processes). The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim on the merits because, since the Elections Assistance Commission is an Executive Agency, \"the Constitution grants the President supervisory authority over members of the Executive Branch, [so] he may lawfully direct how they carry out their statutory duties.\"\n\nOn July 3, the defendants filed a motion to modify the preliminary injunction. Pointing to the Supreme Court's recent decision in\u00a0Casa Inc. v. Trump [../../../../case/45965/], in which the Supreme Court held that federal courts lacked power to issue injunctions that provide relief to individuals who are not parties to a case, the defendants argued that because \"this Court\u2019s preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants from implementing Executive Order 14248\u2019s section 2(d) is broader than necessary to provide complete relief to the Plaintiffs in this case, the Court should grant this motion and modify its injunction concerning section 2(d) to the Plaintiffs.\" The court granted the request on July 18, modifying its preliminary injunction concerning Section 2(d) to only apply to the plaintiff states.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

Finally, the court found that Congress had never endorsed the EO's interpretation regarding absentee and mail-in ballots in its various Election Day statutes and that the EO could not impose conditions on formula grants since the Constitution \"vests exclusive power in Congress to impose conditions on federal grants.\" Therefore, the court enjoined the defendants from implementing any of the challenged sections of the EO. 2025 WL 1667949.\n\nAlso on June 13, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs either lacked standing (since they were challenging actions that allegedly did not affect them) or were bringing claims that were not ripe (since they were bringing claims challenging actions that had not yet occurred, and which still need to go through additional legal and policy processes). The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim on the merits because, since the Elections Assistance Commission is an Executive Agency, \"the Constitution grants the President supervisory authority over members of the Executive Branch, [so] he may lawfully direct how they carry out their statutory duties.\"\n\nOn July 3, the defendants filed a motion to modify the preliminary injunction. Pointing to the Supreme Court's recent decision in\u00a0Casa Inc. v. Trump [../../../../case/45965/], in which the Supreme Court held that federal courts lacked power to issue injunctions that provide relief to individuals who are not parties to a case, the defendants argued that because \"this Court\u2019s preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants from implementing Executive Order 14248\u2019s section 2(d) is broader than necessary to provide complete relief to the Plaintiffs in this case, the Court should grant this motion and modify its injunction concerning section 2(d) to the Plaintiffs.\" The court granted the request on July 18, modifying its preliminary injunction concerning Section 2(d) to only apply to the plaintiff states.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",
    "target_paragraph": "The plaintiffs alleged that by purporting to impose election rules on the states, the President exceeded his constitutional powers and unlawfully infringed on congressional and state authority, thereby violating the Separation of Powers, the Administrative Procedure Act, the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), and the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA). Represented by their respective attorneys general, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorney fees. The case was assigned to District Judge Denise J. Casper.",

On April 3, 2025, nineteen states filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, naming President Donald Trump, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and its director and commissioners, and the Secretary of Defense as Defendants. They challenged multiple sections of Executive Order 14248, titled \"Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,\" signed on March 25, 2025. These sections:\n\n\u2022 Require the EAC to demand documentary proof of citizenship and to record such information,   \u2022 Require the heads of federal voter registration agencies to assess citizenship prior to providing registration forms,   \u2022 Order the Secretary of Defense to require proof of citizenship in the Federal Post Card Application,   \u2022 Command the Attorney General to take action against states that count absentee ballots received after Election Day, and   \u2022 Condition federal funding upon compliance with the EO.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that by purporting to impose election rules on the states, the President exceeded his constitutional powers and unlawfully infringed on congressional and state authority, thereby violating the Separation of Powers, the Administrative Procedure Act, the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), and the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA).

Finally, the court found that Congress had never endorsed the EO's interpretation regarding absentee and mail-in ballots in its various Election Day statutes and that the EO could not impose conditions on formula grants since the Constitution \"vests exclusive power in Congress to impose conditions on federal grants.\" Therefore, the court enjoined the defendants from implementing any of the challenged sections of the EO. 2025 WL 1667949.\n\nAlso on June 13, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs either lacked standing (since they were challenging actions that allegedly did not affect them) or were bringing claims that were not ripe (since they were bringing claims challenging actions that had not yet occurred, and which still need to go through additional legal and policy processes). The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim on the merits because, since the Elections Assistance Commission is an Executive Agency, \"the Constitution grants the President supervisory authority over members of the Executive Branch, [so] he may lawfully direct how they carry out their statutory duties.\"\n\nOn July 3, the defendants filed a motion to modify the preliminary injunction. Pointing to the Supreme Court's recent decision in\u00a0Casa Inc. v. Trump [../../../../case/45965/], in which the Supreme Court held that federal courts lacked power to issue injunctions that provide relief to individuals who are not parties to a case, the defendants argued that because \"this Court\u2019s preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants from implementing Executive Order 14248\u2019s section 2(d) is broader than necessary to provide complete relief to the Plaintiffs in this case, the Court should grant this motion and modify its injunction concerning section 2(d) to the Plaintiffs.\" The court granted the request on July 18, modifying its preliminary injunction concerning Section 2(d) to only apply to the plaintiff states.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case challenged Executive Order 14248, which imposed various requirements on federal elections. On April 3, 2025, nineteen states filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, naming President Donald Trump, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and its director and commissioners, and the Secretary of Defense as Defendants. They challenged multiple sections of Executive Order 14248, titled \"Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,\" signed on March 25, 2025. These sections:\n\n\u2022 Require the EAC to demand documentary proof of citizenship and to record such information,   \u2022 Require the heads of federal voter registration agencies to assess citizenship prior to providing registration forms,   \u2022 Order the Secretary of Defense to require proof of citizenship in the Federal Post Card Application,   \u2022 Command the Attorney General to take action against states that count absentee ballots received after Election Day, and   \u2022 Condition federal funding upon compliance with the EO.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that by purporting to impose election rules on the states, the President exceeded his constitutional powers and unlawfully infringed on congressional and state authority, thereby violating the Separation of Powers, the Administrative Procedure Act, the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), and the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA). Represented by their respective attorneys general, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorney fees. The case was assigned to District Judge Denise J. Casper.\n\nOn April 23, the defendants moved to transfer and consolidate this case with a case in the District Court for the District of Columbia, League of United Latin American Citizens v. Executive Office of the President [../../../../case/46322/], which also challenged the EO. Judge Casper denied the motion on May 9, finding that transfer was not in the interests of justice in this case, given that the plaintiffs here were states, not private parties, and this case challenged different sections of the EO from those challenged in the D.D.C. case.\n\nOn May 5, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. The court granted the motion on June 13, finding that the challenged sections were ripe for review since they either imposed deadlines or clearly laid out actions that the defendants were required to take. Turning to the merits, the court found that the President lacked the authority to take the actions challenged, since in federal statutes such as the NVRA, the HAVA, and the UOCAVA, Congress set requirements for federal elections that did not include those required by the EO. Finally, the court found that Congress had never endorsed the EO's interpretation regarding absentee and mail-in ballots in its various Election Day statutes and that the EO could not impose conditions on formula grants since the Constitution \"vests exclusive power in Congress to impose conditions on federal grants.\" Therefore, the court enjoined the defendants from implementing any of the challenged sections of the EO. 2025 WL 1667949.\n\nAlso on June 13, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs either lacked standing (since they were challenging actions that allegedly did not affect them) or were bringing claims that were not ripe (since they were bringing claims challenging actions that had not yet occurred, and which still need to go through additional legal and policy processes). The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim on the merits because, since the Elections Assistance Commission is an Executive Agency, \"the Constitution grants the President supervisory authority over members of the Executive Branch, [so] he may lawfully direct how they carry out their statutory duties.\"\n\nOn July 3, the defendants filed a motion to modify the preliminary injunction. Pointing to the Supreme Court's recent decision in\u00a0Casa Inc. v. Trump [../../../../case/45965/], in which the Supreme Court held that federal courts lacked power to issue injunctions that provide relief to individuals who are not parties to a case, the defendants argued that because \"this Court\u2019s preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants from implementing Executive Order 14248\u2019s section 2(d) is broader than necessary to provide complete relief to the Plaintiffs in this case, the Court should grant this motion and modify its injunction concerning section 2(d) to the Plaintiffs.\" The court granted the request on July 18, modifying its preliminary injunction concerning Section 2(d) to only apply to the plaintiff states.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",
