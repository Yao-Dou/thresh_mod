    "target": "On April 28, 2025, the American Federation of Government Employees and several other labor organizations, nonprofits, and cities/counties filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. They named President Donald Trump and numerous federal departments and agencies and their agency heads as Defendants. The Plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14210, which ordered agencies across the federal government to engage in a radical transformation of the federal bureaucracy, including by conducting large-scale Reductions in Force (RIFs), without Congressional authorization. They challenged the executive order and implementing memoranda under the Separation of Powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Susan Illston. On May 1, 2025, plaintiffs filed for a temporary restraining order. After a hearing on May 9, 2025, Judge Illston granted a 14-day temporary restraining order, applicable to the following department:\u00a0\u00a0OMB, OPM, DOGE, USDA, Commerce, Energy, HHS, HUD, Interior, Labor, State, Treasury, Transportation, VA, AmeriCorps, EPA, GSA, NLRB, NSF, SBA, and SSA.\u00a0 The order paused any further reductions in force and compelled speedy limited discovery.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal, and sought a stay pending appellate litigation.\u00a0 The district court declined to enter a stay, and the 9th Circuit set a schedule for briefing to proceed through May 22 (the day before the TRO is set to expire unless extended).\u00a0 On May 16, the government asked the Supreme Court to grant a stay.\n\nBack in the district court, after briefing, on May 22, 2025, Judge Illston granted a preliminary injunction, barring the challenged government actions during the pendency of the litigation. Following the lead of numerous other courts, Judge Illston rejected the arguement that the agencies were acting of their own accord and were not directed by OMB. Judge Illston held the President would exceed his authority by dismantling programs authorized by Congress. The court reasoned that the dramatic staff reductions will render the agencies unable to do what Congress directs the agencies to do. In light of the evidence, Judge Illston held that the plaintiff's were likely to succeed in their claims that the defendants exceeded their statutory and constitutional authority. American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. Supp. 3d, 2025 WL 1358477 (N.D. Cal. 2025). The government filled an appeal and a motion for a stay pending appeal with the 9th Circuit, on May 23.\u00a0 (This mooted the request for a stay of the TRO pending before the Supreme Court, so the government withdrew that request.)\n\nOn May 30, 2025, the 9th Circuit denied a stay of the preliminary injunction, holding in a published opinion by Circuit Judge William A. Fletcher (joined by Circuit Judge Lucy H. Koh) that\u00a0\u00a0\"the government does not 'suffer by a temporary preservation of the status quo,'\" and was likely to lose the case. First looking at jurisdiction, the court found that the plaintiffs' claims were not appropriately channeled through the comprehensive administrative system established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), because the CSRA did not give any administrative tribunal the authority to address broad challenges to the defendants' constitutional and statutory authority to direct large-scale federal reorganizations and reductions in force.\u00a0 On the merits, the court found that neither the Constitution nor any federal statute grants the President the authority to direct the kind of large-scale reorganization of the federal government at issue, noting that the challenged RIFs appear \"inextricably intertwined with broad agency reorganization, which the president undoubtedly cannot undertake without Congress.\" American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. 4th, 2025 WL 1541714 (9th Cir. 2025).  A dissent by Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan countered that Article II of the Constitution vests the President with sufficient authority to cover the challenged conduct.\u00a0 Judge Callahan dissented that the Executive Order and memorandum merely directed agencies to exercise their own lawful statutory authority and that the district court erred by not finding whether specific RIFs would violate statutory mandates or eliminate agencies.\n\nThe government filed a Supreme Court application for a stay on June 2, 2025. The stay application was presented to Justice Kagan. On July 8, the Court granted the stay of the preliminary injunction entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California pending the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and the disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari. The Court reasoned that the executive order and implementing memoranda themselves were likely legal as they only direct agencies to plan reorganizations in force \"consistent with applicable law.\". The Court declined to express a view on the legality of the Agency RIF or Agency RIF and Reorganization Plan (ARRPs) saying that it was outside the scope of the question in front of them.\n\nJustice Jackson dissented from grant of application for stay. She argued that the Court made this determination outside of the facts and evidence necessary to \"responsibly override, reasoned lower court fact-finding.\" Justice Jackson pointed to the District Court's preliminary findings (which were based \"on actual evidence\") and argued that the Supreme Court should have declined to intervene. The Court resting the granting of the stay on the merits of the case was inappropriate because the District Court issued an injunction based on the facts collected. She further argued that the executive order and memorandum themselves were unconstitutional executive action that does not \"rest on any grant of reorganization authority by Congress.\"\n\nIn response to the stay by the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs asked Judge Illston to reconsider the plaintiffs' request that the government turn over the specific agency proposals for reductions-in-force (RIFs). The government asserted that these documents were protected by the deliberative process privilege. However, Judge Illston rejected this argument, finding that the documents were \"likely not pre-decisional and deliberative documents.\" Judge Illston then ordered the government to respond to the plaintiffs' request by July 14, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for an order shortening the government's time to respond to the discovery request for the RIFs and AARPs (from the standard 30 days to 14 days). The government responded by saying that all the plaintiffs' claim were APA claims and thus, there is no basis for any discovery in the adjudication of those claims.\n\nOn July 15, the government moved for a protective order and/or to quash the plaintiffs' request for production of documents. The motion consisted of seven major claims:\n\n\u2022 Discovery is premature because the government still had not responded to the complaint and was planning on moving to dismiss the complaint. The government requested the court rule on the forthcoming motion first before the request for discovery.   \u2022 The government reiterated that it would be inappropriate to grant discovery in the adjudication of an APA claim, particularly before an administrative record is certified.   \u2022 The requested information is not relevant in light of the stay by the Supreme Court.   \u2022 DOGE and United States DOGE services are not agencies that can be sued subject to the APA. The discovery sought against them is without basis.   \u2022 The Request for Production (RFP) 1 seeks documents that should be protected by deliberative process privilege.   \u2022 The plaintiffs' demand for application for waivers of RIF notice periods and all responses by OMB or OPM to those applications are not relevant to the issues before the court.   \u2022 The discovery sought by the plaintiffs is outside the scope of relief the court could grant. The court cannot review the lawfulness of the ARRPs because they are not final agency actions under the APA.\n\nJudge Illston granted this motion in part and denied it in part on July 18. The court reject the government's assertion that the Supreme Court's stay \"ends this case\" because the stay did not reach several claims in the amended complaint. The Supreme Court's decision did not foreclose considerations of the legality of the ARRPs (\"In a concurrence, Justice Sotomayor noted that the Supreme Court's decision allows the district court to consider the legality of the ARRPs in the 'first instance.'\") Judge Illston reiterated that a full review of the ARRPs would \"significantly aid the Court's review of the merits of these APA claims.\" Judge Illston rejected the government's argument that the plaintiffs never challenged any of the ARRPs as being arbitrary and capricious. She argued that the defendants are \" [arguing] essentially that plaintiffs cannot prove their case because plaintiffs do not have the ARRPs because the ARRPs have not been made public.\" Judge Illston held that the Ninth Circuit has consistently recognized \"narrow exceptions\" to the general rule that the reviewal of APA claims are limited to the administrative record. Finally, the court held that even if some material within the ARRPs should be protected by deliberative process privilege, \"the need for accurate fact finding overrides the government's interest in non-disclosure.\"\n\nHowever, at this point, Judge Illston limited the distribution of the ARRPs to the plaintiffs' counsel and the court. The court also allowed the defendants to redact any material addressing union negotiating strategy to the plaintiffs' counsel. The government was ordered to provide the full version to the court and to highlight any redacted material.\n\nThe government filed two motions on July 21: a motion to dismiss and a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The government alleged that in light of the Supreme Court's decision, all the plaintiff's claims fail. This is due to the fact that all the claims in the amended complaint \"depend on the assertion that the Workforce Executive Order, the Workforce Memorandum, or both are unlawful.\" Further, the government alleged that to the extent the complaint challenges the ARPs, the ARPs are not final agency actions subject to review under the APA. The government complains that the allegations regarding the RIFs and the ARPs are speculation about future actions the government will take. In regards to the jurisdiction arguments, the government argued that challenges to the lawfulness of federal agency personnel action are precluded from district court review. The government reasserted its claim that the complaint be dismissed as to DOGE which is an initiative and not an agency that can be sued.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the government filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, seeking review of the court's July 18 discovery order. The district court released a statement in response to augment the appellate record. Judge Illston noted that in the government's application for a stay from the Supreme Court, the U.S. Solicitor General represented that 40 RIFs in 17 agencies were in progress and enjoined. However, in response to the discovery order, the petitioners produced a list of those represented RIFs, and numerous agencies that were not defendants in the case (and therefore, not enjoined by the preliminary injunction) were included in the figure presented to the Supreme Court. Judge Illston highlighted that this is no insignificant discrepancy and she reasserted her previous finding that \"any deliberative process privilege. . .is overridden by 'the need for accurate fact-finding in this litigation.'\"\n\nJudge Illston denied the plaintiffs' request for an order requiring production of the administrative record. The court found that much of the information plaintiffs sought from an administrative record overlapped with other discovery requests that plaintiffs issued and on which the court had already ruled. The court suggested the plaintiffs clarify some of their APA claims to give the government a more \"specific understanding of the challenged final agency actions\" so that the government can be \"expected to produce an administrative record for those actions.\"\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

The government filled an appeal and a motion for a stay pending appeal with the 9th Circuit, on May 23.\u00a0 (This mooted the request for a stay of the TRO pending before the Supreme Court, so the government withdrew that request.)\n\nOn May 30, 2025, the 9th Circuit denied a stay of the preliminary injunction, holding in a published opinion by Circuit Judge William A. Fletcher (joined by Circuit Judge Lucy H. Koh) that\u00a0\u00a0\"the government does not 'suffer by a temporary preservation of the status quo,'\" and was likely to lose the case. First looking at jurisdiction, the court found that the plaintiffs' claims were not appropriately channeled through the comprehensive administrative system established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), because the CSRA did not give any administrative tribunal the authority to address broad challenges to the defendants' constitutional and statutory authority to direct large-scale federal reorganizations and reductions in force.\u00a0 On the merits, the court found that neither the Constitution nor any federal statute grants the President the authority to direct the kind of large-scale reorganization of the federal government at issue, noting that the challenged RIFs appear \"inextricably intertwined with broad agency reorganization, which the president undoubtedly cannot undertake without Congress.\" American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. 4th, 2025 WL 1541714 (9th Cir. 2025).  A dissent by Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan countered that Article II of the Constitution vests the President with sufficient authority to cover the challenged conduct.\u00a0 Judge Callahan dissented that the Executive Order and memorandum merely directed agencies to exercise their own lawful statutory authority and that the district court erred by not finding whether specific RIFs would violate statutory mandates or eliminate agencies.\n\nThe government filed a Supreme Court application for a stay on June 2, 2025. The stay application was presented to Justice Kagan. On July 8, the Court granted the stay of the preliminary injunction entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California pending the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and the disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari. The Court reasoned that the executive order and implementing memoranda themselves were likely legal as they only direct agencies to plan reorganizations in force \"consistent with applicable law.\". The Court declined to express a view on the legality of the Agency RIF or Agency RIF and Reorganization Plan (ARRPs) saying that it was outside the scope of the question in front of them.\n\nJustice Jackson dissented from grant of application for stay. She argued that the Court made this determination outside of the facts and evidence necessary to \"responsibly override, reasoned lower court fact-finding.\" Justice Jackson pointed to the District Court's preliminary findings (which were based \"on actual evidence\") and argued that the Supreme Court should have declined to intervene. The Court resting the granting of the stay on the merits of the case was inappropriate because the District Court issued an injunction based on the facts collected. She further argued that the executive order and memorandum themselves were unconstitutional executive action that does not \"rest on any grant of reorganization authority by Congress.\"\n\nIn response to the stay by the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs asked Judge Illston to reconsider the plaintiffs' request that the government turn over the specific agency proposals for reductions-in-force (RIFs). The government asserted that these documents were protected by the deliberative process privilege. However, Judge Illston rejected this argument, finding that the documents were \"likely not pre-decisional and deliberative documents.\" Judge Illston then ordered the government to respond to the plaintiffs' request by July 14, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for an order shortening the government's time to respond to the discovery request for the RIFs and AARPs (from the standard 30 days to 14 days). The government responded by saying that all the plaintiffs' claim were APA claims and thus, there is no basis for any discovery in the adjudication of those claims.\n\nOn July 15, the government moved for a protective order and/or to quash the plaintiffs' request for production of documents. The motion consisted of seven major claims:\n\n\u2022 Discovery is premature because the government still had not responded to the complaint and was planning on moving to dismiss the complaint. The government requested the court rule on the forthcoming motion first before the request for discovery.   \u2022 The government reiterated that it would be inappropriate to grant discovery in the adjudication of an APA claim, particularly before an administrative record is certified.   \u2022 The requested information is not relevant in light of the stay by the Supreme Court.   \u2022 DOGE and United States DOGE services are not agencies that can be sued subject to the APA. The discovery sought against them is without basis.   \u2022 The Request for Production (RFP) 1 seeks documents that should be protected by deliberative process privilege.   \u2022 The plaintiffs' demand for application for waivers of RIF notice periods and all responses by OMB or OPM to those applications are not relevant to the issues before the court.   \u2022 The discovery sought by the plaintiffs is outside the scope of relief the court could grant. The court cannot review the lawfulness of the ARRPs because they are not final agency actions under the APA.\n\nJudge Illston granted this motion in part and denied it in part on July 18. The court reject the government's assertion that the Supreme Court's stay \"ends this case\" because the stay did not reach several claims in the amended complaint. The Supreme Court's decision did not foreclose considerations of the legality of the ARRPs (\"In a concurrence, Justice Sotomayor noted that the Supreme Court's decision allows the district court to consider the legality of the ARRPs in the 'first instance.'\") Judge Illston reiterated that a full review of the ARRPs would \"significantly aid the Court's review of the merits of these APA claims.\" Judge Illston rejected the government's argument that the plaintiffs never challenged any of the ARRPs as being arbitrary and capricious. She argued that the defendants are \" [arguing] essentially that plaintiffs cannot prove their case because plaintiffs do not have the ARRPs because the ARRPs have not been made public.\" Judge Illston held that the Ninth Circuit has consistently recognized \"narrow exceptions\" to the general rule that the reviewal of APA claims are limited to the administrative record. Finally, the court held that even if some material within the ARRPs should be protected by deliberative process privilege, \"the need for accurate fact finding overrides the government's interest in non-disclosure.\"\n\nHowever, at this point, Judge Illston limited the distribution of the ARRPs to the plaintiffs' counsel and the court. The court also allowed the defendants to redact any material addressing union negotiating strategy to the plaintiffs' counsel. The government was ordered to provide the full version to the court and to highlight any redacted material.\n\nThe government filed two motions on July 21: a motion to dismiss and a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The government alleged that in light of the Supreme Court's decision, all the plaintiff's claims fail. This is due to the fact that all the claims in the amended complaint \"depend on the assertion that the Workforce Executive Order, the Workforce Memorandum, or both are unlawful.\" Further, the government alleged that to the extent the complaint challenges the ARPs, the ARPs are not final agency actions subject to review under the APA. The government complains that the allegations regarding the RIFs and the ARPs are speculation about future actions the government will take. In regards to the jurisdiction arguments, the government argued that challenges to the lawfulness of federal agency personnel action are precluded from district court review. The government reasserted its claim that the complaint be dismissed as to DOGE which is an initiative and not an agency that can be sued.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the government filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, seeking review of the court's July 18 discovery order. The district court released a statement in response to augment the appellate record. Judge Illston noted that in the government's application for a stay from the Supreme Court, the U.S. Solicitor General represented that 40 RIFs in 17 agencies were in progress and enjoined. However, in response to the discovery order, the petitioners produced a list of those represented RIFs, and numerous agencies that were not defendants in the case (and therefore, not enjoined by the preliminary injunction) were included in the figure presented to the Supreme Court. Judge Illston highlighted that this is no insignificant discrepancy and she reasserted her previous finding that \"any deliberative process privilege. . .is overridden by 'the need for accurate fact-finding in this litigation.'\"\n\nJudge Illston denied the plaintiffs' request for an order requiring production of the administrative record. The court found that much of the information plaintiffs sought from an administrative record overlapped with other discovery requests that plaintiffs issued and on which the court had already ruled. The court suggested the plaintiffs clarify some of their APA claims to give the government a more \"specific understanding of the challenged final agency actions\" so that the government can be \"expected to produce an administrative record for those actions.\"\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "On April 28, 2025, the American Federation of Government Employees and several other labor organizations, nonprofits, and cities/counties filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. They named President Donald Trump and numerous federal departments and agencies and their agency heads as Defendants. The Plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14210, which ordered agencies across the federal government to engage in a radical transformation of the federal bureaucracy, including by conducting large-scale Reductions in Force (RIFs), without Congressional authorization. They challenged the executive order and implementing memoranda under the Separation of Powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Susan Illston. On May 1, 2025, plaintiffs filed for a temporary restraining order. After a hearing on May 9, 2025, Judge Illston granted a 14-day temporary restraining order, applicable to the following department:\u00a0\u00a0OMB, OPM, DOGE, USDA, Commerce, Energy, HHS, HUD, Interior, Labor, State, Treasury, Transportation, VA, AmeriCorps, EPA, GSA, NLRB, NSF, SBA, and SSA.\u00a0 The order paused any further reductions in force and compelled speedy limited discovery.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal, and sought a stay pending appellate litigation.\u00a0 The district court declined to enter a stay, and the 9th Circuit set a schedule for briefing to proceed through May 22 (the day before the TRO is set to expire unless extended).\u00a0 On May 16, the government asked the Supreme Court to grant a stay.\n\nBack in the district court, after briefing, on May 22, 2025, Judge Illston granted a preliminary injunction, barring the challenged government actions during the pendency of the litigation. Following the lead of numerous other courts, Judge Illston rejected the arguement that the agencies were acting of their own accord and were not directed by OMB. Judge Illston held the President would exceed his authority by dismantling programs authorized by Congress. The court reasoned that the dramatic staff reductions will render the agencies unable to do what Congress directs the agencies to do. In light of the evidence, Judge Illston held that the plaintiff's were likely to succeed in their claims that the defendants exceeded their statutory and constitutional authority. American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. Supp. 3d, 2025 WL 1358477 (N.D. Cal. 2025).

    "target": "On April 28, 2025, the American Federation of Government Employees and several other labor organizations, nonprofits, and cities/counties filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. They named President Donald Trump and numerous federal departments and agencies and their agency heads as Defendants. The Plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14210, which ordered agencies across the federal government to engage in a radical transformation of the federal bureaucracy, including by conducting large-scale Reductions in Force (RIFs), without Congressional authorization. They challenged the executive order and implementing memoranda under the Separation of Powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Susan Illston. On May 1, 2025, plaintiffs filed for a temporary restraining order. After a hearing on May 9, 2025, Judge Illston granted a 14-day temporary restraining order, applicable to the following department:\u00a0\u00a0OMB, OPM, DOGE, USDA, Commerce, Energy, HHS, HUD, Interior, Labor, State, Treasury, Transportation, VA, AmeriCorps, EPA, GSA, NLRB, NSF, SBA, and SSA.\u00a0 The order paused any further reductions in force and compelled speedy limited discovery.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal, and sought a stay pending appellate litigation.\u00a0 The district court declined to enter a stay, and the 9th Circuit set a schedule for briefing to proceed through May 22 (the day before the TRO is set to expire unless extended).\u00a0 On May 16, the government asked the Supreme Court to grant a stay.\n\nBack in the district court, after briefing, on May 22, 2025, Judge Illston granted a preliminary injunction, barring the challenged government actions during the pendency of the litigation. Following the lead of numerous other courts, Judge Illston rejected the arguement that the agencies were acting of their own accord and were not directed by OMB. Judge Illston held the President would exceed his authority by dismantling programs authorized by Congress. The court reasoned that the dramatic staff reductions will render the agencies unable to do what Congress directs the agencies to do. In light of the evidence, Judge Illston held that the plaintiff's were likely to succeed in their claims that the defendants exceeded their statutory and constitutional authority. American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. Supp. 3d, 2025 WL 1358477 (N.D. Cal. 2025). The government filled an appeal and a motion for a stay pending appeal with the 9th Circuit, on May 23.\u00a0 (This mooted the request for a stay of the TRO pending before the Supreme Court, so the government withdrew that request.)\n\nOn May 30, 2025, the 9th Circuit denied a stay of the preliminary injunction, holding in a published opinion by Circuit Judge William A. Fletcher (joined by Circuit Judge Lucy H. Koh) that\u00a0\u00a0\"the government does not 'suffer by a temporary preservation of the status quo,'\" and was likely to lose the case. First looking at jurisdiction, the court found that the plaintiffs' claims were not appropriately channeled through the comprehensive administrative system established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), because the CSRA did not give any administrative tribunal the authority to address broad challenges to the defendants' constitutional and statutory authority to direct large-scale federal reorganizations and reductions in force.\u00a0 On the merits, the court found that neither the Constitution nor any federal statute grants the President the authority to direct the kind of large-scale reorganization of the federal government at issue, noting that the challenged RIFs appear \"inextricably intertwined with broad agency reorganization, which the president undoubtedly cannot undertake without Congress.\" American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. 4th, 2025 WL 1541714 (9th Cir. 2025).  A dissent by Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan countered that Article II of the Constitution vests the President with sufficient authority to cover the challenged conduct.\u00a0 Judge Callahan dissented that the Executive Order and memorandum merely directed agencies to exercise their own lawful statutory authority and that the district court erred by not finding whether specific RIFs would violate statutory mandates or eliminate agencies.\n\nThe government filed a Supreme Court application for a stay on June 2, 2025. The stay application was presented to Justice Kagan. On July 8, the Court granted the stay of the preliminary injunction entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California pending the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and the disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari. The Court reasoned that the executive order and implementing memoranda themselves were likely legal as they only direct agencies to plan reorganizations in force \"consistent with applicable law.\". The Court declined to express a view on the legality of the Agency RIF or Agency RIF and Reorganization Plan (ARRPs) saying that it was outside the scope of the question in front of them.\n\nJustice Jackson dissented from grant of application for stay. She argued that the Court made this determination outside of the facts and evidence necessary to \"responsibly override, reasoned lower court fact-finding.\" Justice Jackson pointed to the District Court's preliminary findings (which were based \"on actual evidence\") and argued that the Supreme Court should have declined to intervene. The Court resting the granting of the stay on the merits of the case was inappropriate because the District Court issued an injunction based on the facts collected. She further argued that the executive order and memorandum themselves were unconstitutional executive action that does not \"rest on any grant of reorganization authority by Congress.\"\n\nIn response to the stay by the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs asked Judge Illston to reconsider the plaintiffs' request that the government turn over the specific agency proposals for reductions-in-force (RIFs). The government asserted that these documents were protected by the deliberative process privilege. However, Judge Illston rejected this argument, finding that the documents were \"likely not pre-decisional and deliberative documents.\" Judge Illston then ordered the government to respond to the plaintiffs' request by July 14, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for an order shortening the government's time to respond to the discovery request for the RIFs and AARPs (from the standard 30 days to 14 days). The government responded by saying that all the plaintiffs' claim were APA claims and thus, there is no basis for any discovery in the adjudication of those claims.\n\nOn July 15, the government moved for a protective order and/or to quash the plaintiffs' request for production of documents. The motion consisted of seven major claims:\n\n\u2022 Discovery is premature because the government still had not responded to the complaint and was planning on moving to dismiss the complaint. The government requested the court rule on the forthcoming motion first before the request for discovery.   \u2022 The government reiterated that it would be inappropriate to grant discovery in the adjudication of an APA claim, particularly before an administrative record is certified.   \u2022 The requested information is not relevant in light of the stay by the Supreme Court.   \u2022 DOGE and United States DOGE services are not agencies that can be sued subject to the APA. The discovery sought against them is without basis.   \u2022 The Request for Production (RFP) 1 seeks documents that should be protected by deliberative process privilege.   \u2022 The plaintiffs' demand for application for waivers of RIF notice periods and all responses by OMB or OPM to those applications are not relevant to the issues before the court.   \u2022 The discovery sought by the plaintiffs is outside the scope of relief the court could grant. The court cannot review the lawfulness of the ARRPs because they are not final agency actions under the APA.\n\nJudge Illston granted this motion in part and denied it in part on July 18. The court reject the government's assertion that the Supreme Court's stay \"ends this case\" because the stay did not reach several claims in the amended complaint. The Supreme Court's decision did not foreclose considerations of the legality of the ARRPs (\"In a concurrence, Justice Sotomayor noted that the Supreme Court's decision allows the district court to consider the legality of the ARRPs in the 'first instance.'\") Judge Illston reiterated that a full review of the ARRPs would \"significantly aid the Court's review of the merits of these APA claims.\" Judge Illston rejected the government's argument that the plaintiffs never challenged any of the ARRPs as being arbitrary and capricious. She argued that the defendants are \" [arguing] essentially that plaintiffs cannot prove their case because plaintiffs do not have the ARRPs because the ARRPs have not been made public.\" Judge Illston held that the Ninth Circuit has consistently recognized \"narrow exceptions\" to the general rule that the reviewal of APA claims are limited to the administrative record. Finally, the court held that even if some material within the ARRPs should be protected by deliberative process privilege, \"the need for accurate fact finding overrides the government's interest in non-disclosure.\"\n\nHowever, at this point, Judge Illston limited the distribution of the ARRPs to the plaintiffs' counsel and the court. The court also allowed the defendants to redact any material addressing union negotiating strategy to the plaintiffs' counsel. The government was ordered to provide the full version to the court and to highlight any redacted material.\n\nThe government filed two motions on July 21: a motion to dismiss and a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The government alleged that in light of the Supreme Court's decision, all the plaintiff's claims fail. This is due to the fact that all the claims in the amended complaint \"depend on the assertion that the Workforce Executive Order, the Workforce Memorandum, or both are unlawful.\" Further, the government alleged that to the extent the complaint challenges the ARPs, the ARPs are not final agency actions subject to review under the APA. The government complains that the allegations regarding the RIFs and the ARPs are speculation about future actions the government will take. In regards to the jurisdiction arguments, the government argued that challenges to the lawfulness of federal agency personnel action are precluded from district court review. The government reasserted its claim that the complaint be dismissed as to DOGE which is an initiative and not an agency that can be sued.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the government filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, seeking review of the court's July 18 discovery order. The district court released a statement in response to augment the appellate record. Judge Illston noted that in the government's application for a stay from the Supreme Court, the U.S. Solicitor General represented that 40 RIFs in 17 agencies were in progress and enjoined. However, in response to the discovery order, the petitioners produced a list of those represented RIFs, and numerous agencies that were not defendants in the case (and therefore, not enjoined by the preliminary injunction) were included in the figure presented to the Supreme Court. Judge Illston highlighted that this is no insignificant discrepancy and she reasserted her previous finding that \"any deliberative process privilege. . .is overridden by 'the need for accurate fact-finding in this litigation.'\"\n\nJudge Illston denied the plaintiffs' request for an order requiring production of the administrative record. The court found that much of the information plaintiffs sought from an administrative record overlapped with other discovery requests that plaintiffs issued and on which the court had already ruled. The court suggested the plaintiffs clarify some of their APA claims to give the government a more \"specific understanding of the challenged final agency actions\" so that the government can be \"expected to produce an administrative record for those actions.\"\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

The Supreme Court's decision did not foreclose considerations of the legality of the ARRPs (\"In a concurrence, Justice Sotomayor noted that the Supreme Court's decision allows the district court to consider the legality of the ARRPs in the 'first instance.'\") Judge Illston reiterated that a full review of the ARRPs would \"significantly aid the Court's review of the merits of these APA claims.\" Judge Illston rejected the government's argument that the plaintiffs never challenged any of the ARRPs as being arbitrary and capricious. She argued that the defendants are \" [arguing] essentially that plaintiffs cannot prove their case because plaintiffs do not have the ARRPs because the ARRPs have not been made public.\" Judge Illston held that the Ninth Circuit has consistently recognized \"narrow exceptions\" to the general rule that the reviewal of APA claims are limited to the administrative record. Finally, the court held that even if some material within the ARRPs should be protected by deliberative process privilege, \"the need for accurate fact finding overrides the government's interest in non-disclosure.\"\n\nHowever, at this point, Judge Illston limited the distribution of the ARRPs to the plaintiffs' counsel and the court. The court also allowed the defendants to redact any material addressing union negotiating strategy to the plaintiffs' counsel. The government was ordered to provide the full version to the court and to highlight any redacted material.\n\nThe government filed two motions on July 21: a motion to dismiss and a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The government alleged that in light of the Supreme Court's decision, all the plaintiff's claims fail. This is due to the fact that all the claims in the amended complaint \"depend on the assertion that the Workforce Executive Order, the Workforce Memorandum, or both are unlawful.\" Further, the government alleged that to the extent the complaint challenges the ARPs, the ARPs are not final agency actions subject to review under the APA. The government complains that the allegations regarding the RIFs and the ARPs are speculation about future actions the government will take. In regards to the jurisdiction arguments, the government argued that challenges to the lawfulness of federal agency personnel action are precluded from district court review. The government reasserted its claim that the complaint be dismissed as to DOGE which is an initiative and not an agency that can be sued.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the government filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, seeking review of the court's July 18 discovery order. The district court released a statement in response to augment the appellate record. Judge Illston noted that in the government's application for a stay from the Supreme Court, the U.S. Solicitor General represented that 40 RIFs in 17 agencies were in progress and enjoined. However, in response to the discovery order, the petitioners produced a list of those represented RIFs, and numerous agencies that were not defendants in the case (and therefore, not enjoined by the preliminary injunction) were included in the figure presented to the Supreme Court. Judge Illston highlighted that this is no insignificant discrepancy and she reasserted her previous finding that \"any deliberative process privilege. . .is overridden by 'the need for accurate fact-finding in this litigation.'\"\n\nJudge Illston denied the plaintiffs' request for an order requiring production of the administrative record. The court found that much of the information plaintiffs sought from an administrative record overlapped with other discovery requests that plaintiffs issued and on which the court had already ruled. The court suggested the plaintiffs clarify some of their APA claims to give the government a more \"specific understanding of the challenged final agency actions\" so that the government can be \"expected to produce an administrative record for those actions.\"\n\nThis case is ongoing.",
    "target_paragraph": "On May 30, 2025, the 9th Circuit denied a stay of the preliminary injunction, holding in a published opinion by Circuit Judge William A. Fletcher (joined by Circuit Judge Lucy H. Koh) that\u00a0\u00a0\"the government does not 'suffer by a temporary preservation of the status quo,'\" and was likely to lose the case. First looking at jurisdiction, the court found that the plaintiffs' claims were not appropriately channeled through the comprehensive administrative system established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), because the CSRA did not give any administrative tribunal the authority to address broad challenges to the defendants' constitutional and statutory authority to direct large-scale federal reorganizations and reductions in force.\u00a0 On the merits, the court found that neither the Constitution nor any federal statute grants the President the authority to direct the kind of large-scale reorganization of the federal government at issue, noting that the challenged RIFs appear \"inextricably intertwined with broad agency reorganization, which the president undoubtedly cannot undertake without Congress.\" American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v.

    "target": "On April 28, 2025, the American Federation of Government Employees and several other labor organizations, nonprofits, and cities/counties filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. They named President Donald Trump and numerous federal departments and agencies and their agency heads as Defendants. The Plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14210, which ordered agencies across the federal government to engage in a radical transformation of the federal bureaucracy, including by conducting large-scale Reductions in Force (RIFs), without Congressional authorization. They challenged the executive order and implementing memoranda under the Separation of Powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Susan Illston. On May 1, 2025, plaintiffs filed for a temporary restraining order. After a hearing on May 9, 2025, Judge Illston granted a 14-day temporary restraining order, applicable to the following department:\u00a0\u00a0OMB, OPM, DOGE, USDA, Commerce, Energy, HHS, HUD, Interior, Labor, State, Treasury, Transportation, VA, AmeriCorps, EPA, GSA, NLRB, NSF, SBA, and SSA.\u00a0 The order paused any further reductions in force and compelled speedy limited discovery.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal, and sought a stay pending appellate litigation.\u00a0 The district court declined to enter a stay, and the 9th Circuit set a schedule for briefing to proceed through May 22 (the day before the TRO is set to expire unless extended).\u00a0 On May 16, the government asked the Supreme Court to grant a stay.\n\nBack in the district court, after briefing, on May 22, 2025, Judge Illston granted a preliminary injunction, barring the challenged government actions during the pendency of the litigation. Following the lead of numerous other courts, Judge Illston rejected the arguement that the agencies were acting of their own accord and were not directed by OMB. Judge Illston held the President would exceed his authority by dismantling programs authorized by Congress. The court reasoned that the dramatic staff reductions will render the agencies unable to do what Congress directs the agencies to do. In light of the evidence, Judge Illston held that the plaintiff's were likely to succeed in their claims that the defendants exceeded their statutory and constitutional authority. American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. Supp. 3d, 2025 WL 1358477 (N.D. Cal. 2025). The government filled an appeal and a motion for a stay pending appeal with the 9th Circuit, on May 23.\u00a0 (This mooted the request for a stay of the TRO pending before the Supreme Court, so the government withdrew that request.)\n\nOn May 30, 2025, the 9th Circuit denied a stay of the preliminary injunction, holding in a published opinion by Circuit Judge William A. Fletcher (joined by Circuit Judge Lucy H. Koh) that\u00a0\u00a0\"the government does not 'suffer by a temporary preservation of the status quo,'\" and was likely to lose the case. First looking at jurisdiction, the court found that the plaintiffs' claims were not appropriately channeled through the comprehensive administrative system established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), because the CSRA did not give any administrative tribunal the authority to address broad challenges to the defendants' constitutional and statutory authority to direct large-scale federal reorganizations and reductions in force.\u00a0 On the merits, the court found that neither the Constitution nor any federal statute grants the President the authority to direct the kind of large-scale reorganization of the federal government at issue, noting that the challenged RIFs appear \"inextricably intertwined with broad agency reorganization, which the president undoubtedly cannot undertake without Congress.\" American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. 4th, 2025 WL 1541714 (9th Cir. 2025).  A dissent by Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan countered that Article II of the Constitution vests the President with sufficient authority to cover the challenged conduct.\u00a0 Judge Callahan dissented that the Executive Order and memorandum merely directed agencies to exercise their own lawful statutory authority and that the district court erred by not finding whether specific RIFs would violate statutory mandates or eliminate agencies.\n\nThe government filed a Supreme Court application for a stay on June 2, 2025. The stay application was presented to Justice Kagan. On July 8, the Court granted the stay of the preliminary injunction entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California pending the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and the disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari. The Court reasoned that the executive order and implementing memoranda themselves were likely legal as they only direct agencies to plan reorganizations in force \"consistent with applicable law.\". The Court declined to express a view on the legality of the Agency RIF or Agency RIF and Reorganization Plan (ARRPs) saying that it was outside the scope of the question in front of them.\n\nJustice Jackson dissented from grant of application for stay. She argued that the Court made this determination outside of the facts and evidence necessary to \"responsibly override, reasoned lower court fact-finding.\" Justice Jackson pointed to the District Court's preliminary findings (which were based \"on actual evidence\") and argued that the Supreme Court should have declined to intervene. The Court resting the granting of the stay on the merits of the case was inappropriate because the District Court issued an injunction based on the facts collected. She further argued that the executive order and memorandum themselves were unconstitutional executive action that does not \"rest on any grant of reorganization authority by Congress.\"\n\nIn response to the stay by the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs asked Judge Illston to reconsider the plaintiffs' request that the government turn over the specific agency proposals for reductions-in-force (RIFs). The government asserted that these documents were protected by the deliberative process privilege. However, Judge Illston rejected this argument, finding that the documents were \"likely not pre-decisional and deliberative documents.\" Judge Illston then ordered the government to respond to the plaintiffs' request by July 14, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for an order shortening the government's time to respond to the discovery request for the RIFs and AARPs (from the standard 30 days to 14 days). The government responded by saying that all the plaintiffs' claim were APA claims and thus, there is no basis for any discovery in the adjudication of those claims.\n\nOn July 15, the government moved for a protective order and/or to quash the plaintiffs' request for production of documents. The motion consisted of seven major claims:\n\n\u2022 Discovery is premature because the government still had not responded to the complaint and was planning on moving to dismiss the complaint. The government requested the court rule on the forthcoming motion first before the request for discovery.   \u2022 The government reiterated that it would be inappropriate to grant discovery in the adjudication of an APA claim, particularly before an administrative record is certified.   \u2022 The requested information is not relevant in light of the stay by the Supreme Court.   \u2022 DOGE and United States DOGE services are not agencies that can be sued subject to the APA. The discovery sought against them is without basis.   \u2022 The Request for Production (RFP) 1 seeks documents that should be protected by deliberative process privilege.   \u2022 The plaintiffs' demand for application for waivers of RIF notice periods and all responses by OMB or OPM to those applications are not relevant to the issues before the court.   \u2022 The discovery sought by the plaintiffs is outside the scope of relief the court could grant. The court cannot review the lawfulness of the ARRPs because they are not final agency actions under the APA.\n\nJudge Illston granted this motion in part and denied it in part on July 18. The court reject the government's assertion that the Supreme Court's stay \"ends this case\" because the stay did not reach several claims in the amended complaint.

    "target": "On April 28, 2025, the American Federation of Government Employees and several other labor organizations, nonprofits, and cities/counties filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. They named President Donald Trump and numerous federal departments and agencies and their agency heads as Defendants. The Plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14210, which ordered agencies across the federal government to engage in a radical transformation of the federal bureaucracy, including by conducting large-scale Reductions in Force (RIFs), without Congressional authorization. They challenged the executive order and implementing memoranda under the Separation of Powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Susan Illston. On May 1, 2025, plaintiffs filed for a temporary restraining order. After a hearing on May 9, 2025, Judge Illston granted a 14-day temporary restraining order, applicable to the following department:\u00a0\u00a0OMB, OPM, DOGE, USDA, Commerce, Energy, HHS, HUD, Interior, Labor, State, Treasury, Transportation, VA, AmeriCorps, EPA, GSA, NLRB, NSF, SBA, and SSA.\u00a0 The order paused any further reductions in force and compelled speedy limited discovery.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal, and sought a stay pending appellate litigation.\u00a0 The district court declined to enter a stay, and the 9th Circuit set a schedule for briefing to proceed through May 22 (the day before the TRO is set to expire unless extended).\u00a0 On May 16, the government asked the Supreme Court to grant a stay.\n\nBack in the district court, after briefing, on May 22, 2025, Judge Illston granted a preliminary injunction, barring the challenged government actions during the pendency of the litigation. Following the lead of numerous other courts, Judge Illston rejected the arguement that the agencies were acting of their own accord and were not directed by OMB. Judge Illston held the President would exceed his authority by dismantling programs authorized by Congress. The court reasoned that the dramatic staff reductions will render the agencies unable to do what Congress directs the agencies to do. In light of the evidence, Judge Illston held that the plaintiff's were likely to succeed in their claims that the defendants exceeded their statutory and constitutional authority. American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. Supp. 3d, 2025 WL 1358477 (N.D. Cal. 2025). The government filled an appeal and a motion for a stay pending appeal with the 9th Circuit, on May 23.\u00a0 (This mooted the request for a stay of the TRO pending before the Supreme Court, so the government withdrew that request.)\n\nOn May 30, 2025, the 9th Circuit denied a stay of the preliminary injunction, holding in a published opinion by Circuit Judge William A. Fletcher (joined by Circuit Judge Lucy H. Koh) that\u00a0\u00a0\"the government does not 'suffer by a temporary preservation of the status quo,'\" and was likely to lose the case. First looking at jurisdiction, the court found that the plaintiffs' claims were not appropriately channeled through the comprehensive administrative system established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), because the CSRA did not give any administrative tribunal the authority to address broad challenges to the defendants' constitutional and statutory authority to direct large-scale federal reorganizations and reductions in force.\u00a0 On the merits, the court found that neither the Constitution nor any federal statute grants the President the authority to direct the kind of large-scale reorganization of the federal government at issue, noting that the challenged RIFs appear \"inextricably intertwined with broad agency reorganization, which the president undoubtedly cannot undertake without Congress.\" American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. 4th, 2025 WL 1541714 (9th Cir. 2025).  A dissent by Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan countered that Article II of the Constitution vests the President with sufficient authority to cover the challenged conduct.\u00a0 Judge Callahan dissented that the Executive Order and memorandum merely directed agencies to exercise their own lawful statutory authority and that the district court erred by not finding whether specific RIFs would violate statutory mandates or eliminate agencies.\n\nThe government filed a Supreme Court application for a stay on June 2, 2025. The stay application was presented to Justice Kagan. On July 8, the Court granted the stay of the preliminary injunction entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California pending the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and the disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari. The Court reasoned that the executive order and implementing memoranda themselves were likely legal as they only direct agencies to plan reorganizations in force \"consistent with applicable law.\". The Court declined to express a view on the legality of the Agency RIF or Agency RIF and Reorganization Plan (ARRPs) saying that it was outside the scope of the question in front of them.\n\nJustice Jackson dissented from grant of application for stay. She argued that the Court made this determination outside of the facts and evidence necessary to \"responsibly override, reasoned lower court fact-finding.\" Justice Jackson pointed to the District Court's preliminary findings (which were based \"on actual evidence\") and argued that the Supreme Court should have declined to intervene. The Court resting the granting of the stay on the merits of the case was inappropriate because the District Court issued an injunction based on the facts collected. She further argued that the executive order and memorandum themselves were unconstitutional executive action that does not \"rest on any grant of reorganization authority by Congress.\"\n\nIn response to the stay by the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs asked Judge Illston to reconsider the plaintiffs' request that the government turn over the specific agency proposals for reductions-in-force (RIFs). The government asserted that these documents were protected by the deliberative process privilege. However, Judge Illston rejected this argument, finding that the documents were \"likely not pre-decisional and deliberative documents.\" Judge Illston then ordered the government to respond to the plaintiffs' request by July 14, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for an order shortening the government's time to respond to the discovery request for the RIFs and AARPs (from the standard 30 days to 14 days). The government responded by saying that all the plaintiffs' claim were APA claims and thus, there is no basis for any discovery in the adjudication of those claims.\n\nOn July 15, the government moved for a protective order and/or to quash the plaintiffs' request for production of documents. The motion consisted of seven major claims:\n\n\u2022 Discovery is premature because the government still had not responded to the complaint and was planning on moving to dismiss the complaint. The government requested the court rule on the forthcoming motion first before the request for discovery.   \u2022 The government reiterated that it would be inappropriate to grant discovery in the adjudication of an APA claim, particularly before an administrative record is certified.   \u2022 The requested information is not relevant in light of the stay by the Supreme Court.   \u2022 DOGE and United States DOGE services are not agencies that can be sued subject to the APA. The discovery sought against them is without basis.   \u2022 The Request for Production (RFP) 1 seeks documents that should be protected by deliberative process privilege.   \u2022 The plaintiffs' demand for application for waivers of RIF notice periods and all responses by OMB or OPM to those applications are not relevant to the issues before the court.   \u2022 The discovery sought by the plaintiffs is outside the scope of relief the court could grant. The court cannot review the lawfulness of the ARRPs because they are not final agency actions under the APA.\n\nJudge Illston granted this motion in part and denied it in part on July 18. The court reject the government's assertion that the Supreme Court's stay \"ends this case\" because the stay did not reach several claims in the amended complaint. The Supreme Court's decision did not foreclose considerations of the legality of the ARRPs (\"In a concurrence, Justice Sotomayor noted that the Supreme Court's decision allows the district court to consider the legality of the ARRPs in the 'first instance.'\") Judge Illston reiterated that a full review of the ARRPs would \"significantly aid the Court's review of the merits of these APA claims.\" Judge Illston rejected the government's argument that the plaintiffs never challenged any of the ARRPs as being arbitrary and capricious. She argued that the defendants are \" [arguing] essentially that plaintiffs cannot prove their case because plaintiffs do not have the ARRPs because the ARRPs have not been made public.\" Judge Illston held that the Ninth Circuit has consistently recognized \"narrow exceptions\" to the general rule that the reviewal of APA claims are limited to the administrative record. Finally, the court held that even if some material within the ARRPs should be protected by deliberative process privilege, \"the need for accurate fact finding overrides the government's interest in non-disclosure.\"\n\nHowever, at this point, Judge Illston limited the distribution of the ARRPs to the plaintiffs' counsel and the court. The court also allowed the defendants to redact any material addressing union negotiating strategy to the plaintiffs' counsel. The government was ordered to provide the full version to the court and to highlight any redacted material.\n\nThe government filed two motions on July 21: a motion to dismiss and a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The government alleged that in light of the Supreme Court's decision, all the plaintiff's claims fail. This is due to the fact that all the claims in the amended complaint \"depend on the assertion that the Workforce Executive Order, the Workforce Memorandum, or both are unlawful.\" Further, the government alleged that to the extent the complaint challenges the ARPs, the ARPs are not final agency actions subject to review under the APA. The government complains that the allegations regarding the RIFs and the ARPs are speculation about future actions the government will take. In regards to the jurisdiction arguments, the government argued that challenges to the lawfulness of federal agency personnel action are precluded from district court review. The government reasserted its claim that the complaint be dismissed as to DOGE which is an initiative and not an agency that can be sued.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the government filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, seeking review of the court's July 18 discovery order. The district court released a statement in response to augment the appellate record. Judge Illston noted that in the government's application for a stay from the Supreme Court, the U.S. Solicitor General represented that 40 RIFs in 17 agencies were in progress and enjoined. However, in response to the discovery order, the petitioners produced a list of those represented RIFs, and numerous agencies that were not defendants in the case (and therefore, not enjoined by the preliminary injunction) were included in the figure presented to the Supreme Court. Judge Illston highlighted that this is no insignificant discrepancy and she reasserted her previous finding that \"any deliberative process privilege. . .is overridden by 'the need for accurate fact-finding in this litigation.'\"\n\nJudge Illston denied the plaintiffs' request for an order requiring production of the administrative record. The court found that much of the information plaintiffs sought from an administrative record overlapped with other discovery requests that plaintiffs issued and on which the court had already ruled. The court suggested the plaintiffs clarify some of their APA claims to give the government a more \"specific understanding of the challenged final agency actions\" so that the government can be \"expected to produce an administrative record for those actions.\"\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "On April 28, 2025, the American Federation of Government Employees and several other labor organizations, nonprofits, and cities/counties filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. They named President Donald Trump and numerous federal departments and agencies and their agency heads as Defendants. The Plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14210, which ordered agencies across the federal government to engage in a radical transformation of the federal bureaucracy, including by conducting large-scale Reductions in Force (RIFs), without Congressional authorization. They challenged the executive order and implementing memoranda under the Separation of Powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Susan Illston. On May 1, 2025, plaintiffs filed for a temporary restraining order. After a hearing on May 9, 2025, Judge Illston granted a 14-day temporary restraining order, applicable to the following department:\u00a0\u00a0OMB, OPM, DOGE, USDA, Commerce, Energy, HHS, HUD, Interior, Labor, State, Treasury, Transportation, VA, AmeriCorps, EPA, GSA, NLRB, NSF, SBA, and SSA.\u00a0 The order paused any further reductions in force and compelled speedy limited discovery.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal, and sought a stay pending appellate litigation.\u00a0 The district court declined to enter a stay, and the 9th Circuit set a schedule for briefing to proceed through May 22 (the day before the TRO is set to expire unless extended).\u00a0 On May 16, the government asked the Supreme Court to grant a stay.\n\nBack in the district court, after briefing, on May 22, 2025, Judge Illston granted a preliminary injunction, barring the challenged government actions during the pendency of the litigation. Following the lead of numerous other courts, Judge Illston rejected the arguement that the agencies were acting of their own accord and were not directed by OMB. Judge Illston held the President would exceed his authority by dismantling programs authorized by Congress. The court reasoned that the dramatic staff reductions will render the agencies unable to do what Congress directs the agencies to do. In light of the evidence, Judge Illston held that the plaintiff's were likely to succeed in their claims that the defendants exceeded their statutory and constitutional authority. American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. Supp. 3d, 2025 WL 1358477 (N.D. Cal. 2025). The government filled an appeal and a motion for a stay pending appeal with the 9th Circuit, on May 23.\u00a0 (This mooted the request for a stay of the TRO pending before the Supreme Court, so the government withdrew that request.)\n\nOn May 30, 2025, the 9th Circuit denied a stay of the preliminary injunction, holding in a published opinion by Circuit Judge William A. Fletcher (joined by Circuit Judge Lucy H. Koh) that\u00a0\u00a0\"the government does not 'suffer by a temporary preservation of the status quo,'\" and was likely to lose the case. First looking at jurisdiction, the court found that the plaintiffs' claims were not appropriately channeled through the comprehensive administrative system established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), because the CSRA did not give any administrative tribunal the authority to address broad challenges to the defendants' constitutional and statutory authority to direct large-scale federal reorganizations and reductions in force.\u00a0 On the merits, the court found that neither the Constitution nor any federal statute grants the President the authority to direct the kind of large-scale reorganization of the federal government at issue, noting that the challenged RIFs appear \"inextricably intertwined with broad agency reorganization, which the president undoubtedly cannot undertake without Congress.\" American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. 4th, 2025 WL 1541714 (9th Cir. 2025).  A dissent by Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan countered that Article II of the Constitution vests the President with sufficient authority to cover the challenged conduct.\u00a0 Judge Callahan dissented that the Executive Order and memorandum merely directed agencies to exercise their own lawful statutory authority and that the district court erred by not finding whether specific RIFs would violate statutory mandates or eliminate agencies.\n\nThe government filed a Supreme Court application for a stay on June 2, 2025. The stay application was presented to Justice Kagan. On July 8, the Court granted the stay of the preliminary injunction entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California pending the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and the disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari. The Court reasoned that the executive order and implementing memoranda themselves were likely legal as they only direct agencies to plan reorganizations in force \"consistent with applicable law.\". The Court declined to express a view on the legality of the Agency RIF or Agency RIF and Reorganization Plan (ARRPs) saying that it was outside the scope of the question in front of them.\n\nJustice Jackson dissented from grant of application for stay. She argued that the Court made this determination outside of the facts and evidence necessary to \"responsibly override, reasoned lower court fact-finding.\" Justice Jackson pointed to the District Court's preliminary findings (which were based \"on actual evidence\") and argued that the Supreme Court should have declined to intervene. The Court resting the granting of the stay on the merits of the case was inappropriate because the District Court issued an injunction based on the facts collected. She further argued that the executive order and memorandum themselves were unconstitutional executive action that does not \"rest on any grant of reorganization authority by Congress.\"\n\nIn response to the stay by the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs asked Judge Illston to reconsider the plaintiffs' request that the government turn over the specific agency proposals for reductions-in-force (RIFs). The government asserted that these documents were protected by the deliberative process privilege. However, Judge Illston rejected this argument, finding that the documents were \"likely not pre-decisional and deliberative documents.\" Judge Illston then ordered the government to respond to the plaintiffs' request by July 14, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for an order shortening the government's time to respond to the discovery request for the RIFs and AARPs (from the standard 30 days to 14 days). The government responded by saying that all the plaintiffs' claim were APA claims and thus, there is no basis for any discovery in the adjudication of those claims.\n\nOn July 15, the government moved for a protective order and/or to quash the plaintiffs' request for production of documents. The motion consisted of seven major claims:\n\n\u2022 Discovery is premature because the government still had not responded to the complaint and was planning on moving to dismiss the complaint. The government requested the court rule on the forthcoming motion first before the request for discovery.   \u2022 The government reiterated that it would be inappropriate to grant discovery in the adjudication of an APA claim, particularly before an administrative record is certified.   \u2022 The requested information is not relevant in light of the stay by the Supreme Court.   \u2022 DOGE and United States DOGE services are not agencies that can be sued subject to the APA. The discovery sought against them is without basis.   \u2022 The Request for Production (RFP) 1 seeks documents that should be protected by deliberative process privilege.   \u2022 The plaintiffs' demand for application for waivers of RIF notice periods and all responses by OMB or OPM to those applications are not relevant to the issues before the court.   \u2022 The discovery sought by the plaintiffs is outside the scope of relief the court could grant. The court cannot review the lawfulness of the ARRPs because they are not final agency actions under the APA.\n\nJudge Illston granted this motion in part and denied it in part on July 18. The court reject the government's assertion that the Supreme Court's stay \"ends this case\" because the stay did not reach several claims in the amended complaint. The Supreme Court's decision did not foreclose considerations of the legality of the ARRPs (\"In a concurrence, Justice Sotomayor noted that the Supreme Court's decision allows the district court to consider the legality of the ARRPs in the 'first instance.'\") Judge Illston reiterated that a full review of the ARRPs would \"significantly aid the Court's review of the merits of these APA claims.\" Judge Illston rejected the government's argument that the plaintiffs never challenged any of the ARRPs as being arbitrary and capricious. She argued that the defendants are \" [arguing] essentially that plaintiffs cannot prove their case because plaintiffs do not have the ARRPs because the ARRPs have not been made public.\" Judge Illston held that the Ninth Circuit has consistently recognized \"narrow exceptions\" to the general rule that the reviewal of APA claims are limited to the administrative record. Finally, the court held that even if some material within the ARRPs should be protected by deliberative process privilege, \"the need for accurate fact finding overrides the government's interest in non-disclosure.\"\n\nHowever, at this point, Judge Illston limited the distribution of the ARRPs to the plaintiffs' counsel and the court. The court also allowed the defendants to redact any material addressing union negotiating strategy to the plaintiffs' counsel. The government was ordered to provide the full version to the court and to highlight any redacted material.\n\nThe government filed two motions on July 21: a motion to dismiss and a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The government alleged that in light of the Supreme Court's decision, all the plaintiff's claims fail. This is due to the fact that all the claims in the amended complaint \"depend on the assertion that the Workforce Executive Order, the Workforce Memorandum, or both are unlawful.\" Further, the government alleged that to the extent the complaint challenges the ARPs, the ARPs are not final agency actions subject to review under the APA. The government complains that the allegations regarding the RIFs and the ARPs are speculation about future actions the government will take. In regards to the jurisdiction arguments, the government argued that challenges to the lawfulness of federal agency personnel action are precluded from district court review. The government reasserted its claim that the complaint be dismissed as to DOGE which is an initiative and not an agency that can be sued.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the government filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, seeking review of the court's July 18 discovery order. The district court released a statement in response to augment the appellate record. Judge Illston noted that in the government's application for a stay from the Supreme Court, the U.S. Solicitor General represented that 40 RIFs in 17 agencies were in progress and enjoined. However, in response to the discovery order, the petitioners produced a list of those represented RIFs, and numerous agencies that were not defendants in the case (and therefore, not enjoined by the preliminary injunction) were included in the figure presented to the Supreme Court. Judge Illston highlighted that this is no insignificant discrepancy and she reasserted her previous finding that \"any deliberative process privilege. . .is overridden by 'the need for accurate fact-finding in this litigation.'\"\n\nJudge Illston denied the plaintiffs' request for an order requiring production of the administrative record. The court found that much of the information plaintiffs sought from an administrative record overlapped with other discovery requests that plaintiffs issued and on which the court had already ruled. The court suggested the plaintiffs clarify some of their APA claims to give the government a more \"specific understanding of the challenged final agency actions\" so that the government can be \"expected to produce an administrative record for those actions.\"\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

However, in response to the discovery order, the petitioners produced a list of those represented RIFs, and numerous agencies that were not defendants in the case (and therefore, not enjoined by the preliminary injunction) were included in the figure presented to the Supreme Court. Judge Illston highlighted that this is no insignificant discrepancy and she reasserted her previous finding that \"any deliberative process privilege. . .is overridden by 'the need for accurate fact-finding in this litigation.'\"\n\nJudge Illston denied the plaintiffs' request for an order requiring production of the administrative record. The court found that much of the information plaintiffs sought from an administrative record overlapped with other discovery requests that plaintiffs issued and on which the court had already ruled. The court suggested the plaintiffs clarify some of their APA claims to give the government a more \"specific understanding of the challenged final agency actions\" so that the government can be \"expected to produce an administrative record for those actions.\"\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "On April 28, 2025, the American Federation of Government Employees and several other labor organizations, nonprofits, and cities/counties filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. They named President Donald Trump and numerous federal departments and agencies and their agency heads as Defendants. The Plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14210, which ordered agencies across the federal government to engage in a radical transformation of the federal bureaucracy, including by conducting large-scale Reductions in Force (RIFs), without Congressional authorization. They challenged the executive order and implementing memoranda under the Separation of Powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Susan Illston. On May 1, 2025, plaintiffs filed for a temporary restraining order. After a hearing on May 9, 2025, Judge Illston granted a 14-day temporary restraining order, applicable to the following department:\u00a0\u00a0OMB, OPM, DOGE, USDA, Commerce, Energy, HHS, HUD, Interior, Labor, State, Treasury, Transportation, VA, AmeriCorps, EPA, GSA, NLRB, NSF, SBA, and SSA.\u00a0 The order paused any further reductions in force and compelled speedy limited discovery.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal, and sought a stay pending appellate litigation.\u00a0 The district court declined to enter a stay, and the 9th Circuit set a schedule for briefing to proceed through May 22 (the day before the TRO is set to expire unless extended).\u00a0 On May 16, the government asked the Supreme Court to grant a stay.\n\nBack in the district court, after briefing, on May 22, 2025, Judge Illston granted a preliminary injunction, barring the challenged government actions during the pendency of the litigation. Following the lead of numerous other courts, Judge Illston rejected the arguement that the agencies were acting of their own accord and were not directed by OMB. Judge Illston held the President would exceed his authority by dismantling programs authorized by Congress. The court reasoned that the dramatic staff reductions will render the agencies unable to do what Congress directs the agencies to do. In light of the evidence, Judge Illston held that the plaintiff's were likely to succeed in their claims that the defendants exceeded their statutory and constitutional authority. American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. Supp. 3d, 2025 WL 1358477 (N.D. Cal. 2025). The government filled an appeal and a motion for a stay pending appeal with the 9th Circuit, on May 23.\u00a0 (This mooted the request for a stay of the TRO pending before the Supreme Court, so the government withdrew that request.)\n\nOn May 30, 2025, the 9th Circuit denied a stay of the preliminary injunction, holding in a published opinion by Circuit Judge William A. Fletcher (joined by Circuit Judge Lucy H. Koh) that\u00a0\u00a0\"the government does not 'suffer by a temporary preservation of the status quo,'\" and was likely to lose the case. First looking at jurisdiction, the court found that the plaintiffs' claims were not appropriately channeled through the comprehensive administrative system established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), because the CSRA did not give any administrative tribunal the authority to address broad challenges to the defendants' constitutional and statutory authority to direct large-scale federal reorganizations and reductions in force.\u00a0 On the merits, the court found that neither the Constitution nor any federal statute grants the President the authority to direct the kind of large-scale reorganization of the federal government at issue, noting that the challenged RIFs appear \"inextricably intertwined with broad agency reorganization, which the president undoubtedly cannot undertake without Congress.\" American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. 4th, 2025 WL 1541714 (9th Cir. 2025).  A dissent by Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan countered that Article II of the Constitution vests the President with sufficient authority to cover the challenged conduct.\u00a0 Judge Callahan dissented that the Executive Order and memorandum merely directed agencies to exercise their own lawful statutory authority and that the district court erred by not finding whether specific RIFs would violate statutory mandates or eliminate agencies.\n\nThe government filed a Supreme Court application for a stay on June 2, 2025. The stay application was presented to Justice Kagan. On July 8, the Court granted the stay of the preliminary injunction entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California pending the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and the disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari. The Court reasoned that the executive order and implementing memoranda themselves were likely legal as they only direct agencies to plan reorganizations in force \"consistent with applicable law.\". The Court declined to express a view on the legality of the Agency RIF or Agency RIF and Reorganization Plan (ARRPs) saying that it was outside the scope of the question in front of them.\n\nJustice Jackson dissented from grant of application for stay. She argued that the Court made this determination outside of the facts and evidence necessary to \"responsibly override, reasoned lower court fact-finding.\" Justice Jackson pointed to the District Court's preliminary findings (which were based \"on actual evidence\") and argued that the Supreme Court should have declined to intervene. The Court resting the granting of the stay on the merits of the case was inappropriate because the District Court issued an injunction based on the facts collected. She further argued that the executive order and memorandum themselves were unconstitutional executive action that does not \"rest on any grant of reorganization authority by Congress.\"\n\nIn response to the stay by the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs asked Judge Illston to reconsider the plaintiffs' request that the government turn over the specific agency proposals for reductions-in-force (RIFs). The government asserted that these documents were protected by the deliberative process privilege. However, Judge Illston rejected this argument, finding that the documents were \"likely not pre-decisional and deliberative documents.\" Judge Illston then ordered the government to respond to the plaintiffs' request by July 14, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for an order shortening the government's time to respond to the discovery request for the RIFs and AARPs (from the standard 30 days to 14 days). The government responded by saying that all the plaintiffs' claim were APA claims and thus, there is no basis for any discovery in the adjudication of those claims.\n\nOn July 15, the government moved for a protective order and/or to quash the plaintiffs' request for production of documents. The motion consisted of seven major claims:\n\n\u2022 Discovery is premature because the government still had not responded to the complaint and was planning on moving to dismiss the complaint. The government requested the court rule on the forthcoming motion first before the request for discovery.   \u2022 The government reiterated that it would be inappropriate to grant discovery in the adjudication of an APA claim, particularly before an administrative record is certified.   \u2022 The requested information is not relevant in light of the stay by the Supreme Court.   \u2022 DOGE and United States DOGE services are not agencies that can be sued subject to the APA. The discovery sought against them is without basis.   \u2022 The Request for Production (RFP) 1 seeks documents that should be protected by deliberative process privilege.   \u2022 The plaintiffs' demand for application for waivers of RIF notice periods and all responses by OMB or OPM to those applications are not relevant to the issues before the court.   \u2022 The discovery sought by the plaintiffs is outside the scope of relief the court could grant. The court cannot review the lawfulness of the ARRPs because they are not final agency actions under the APA.\n\nJudge Illston granted this motion in part and denied it in part on July 18. The court reject the government's assertion that the Supreme Court's stay \"ends this case\" because the stay did not reach several claims in the amended complaint. The Supreme Court's decision did not foreclose considerations of the legality of the ARRPs (\"In a concurrence, Justice Sotomayor noted that the Supreme Court's decision allows the district court to consider the legality of the ARRPs in the 'first instance.'\") Judge Illston reiterated that a full review of the ARRPs would \"significantly aid the Court's review of the merits of these APA claims.\" Judge Illston rejected the government's argument that the plaintiffs never challenged any of the ARRPs as being arbitrary and capricious. She argued that the defendants are \" [arguing] essentially that plaintiffs cannot prove their case because plaintiffs do not have the ARRPs because the ARRPs have not been made public.\" Judge Illston held that the Ninth Circuit has consistently recognized \"narrow exceptions\" to the general rule that the reviewal of APA claims are limited to the administrative record. Finally, the court held that even if some material within the ARRPs should be protected by deliberative process privilege, \"the need for accurate fact finding overrides the government's interest in non-disclosure.\"\n\nHowever, at this point, Judge Illston limited the distribution of the ARRPs to the plaintiffs' counsel and the court. The court also allowed the defendants to redact any material addressing union negotiating strategy to the plaintiffs' counsel. The government was ordered to provide the full version to the court and to highlight any redacted material.\n\nThe government filed two motions on July 21: a motion to dismiss and a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The government alleged that in light of the Supreme Court's decision, all the plaintiff's claims fail. This is due to the fact that all the claims in the amended complaint \"depend on the assertion that the Workforce Executive Order, the Workforce Memorandum, or both are unlawful.\" Further, the government alleged that to the extent the complaint challenges the ARPs, the ARPs are not final agency actions subject to review under the APA. The government complains that the allegations regarding the RIFs and the ARPs are speculation about future actions the government will take. In regards to the jurisdiction arguments, the government argued that challenges to the lawfulness of federal agency personnel action are precluded from district court review. The government reasserted its claim that the complaint be dismissed as to DOGE which is an initiative and not an agency that can be sued.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the government filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, seeking review of the court's July 18 discovery order. The district court released a statement in response to augment the appellate record. Judge Illston noted that in the government's application for a stay from the Supreme Court, the U.S. Solicitor General represented that 40 RIFs in 17 agencies were in progress and enjoined. However, in response to the discovery order, the petitioners produced a list of those represented RIFs, and numerous agencies that were not defendants in the case (and therefore, not enjoined by the preliminary injunction) were included in the figure presented to the Supreme Court.

Finally, the court held that even if some material within the ARRPs should be protected by deliberative process privilege, \"the need for accurate fact finding overrides the government's interest in non-disclosure.\"",

    "target": "On April 28, 2025, the American Federation of Government Employees and several other labor organizations, nonprofits, and cities/counties filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. They named President Donald Trump and numerous federal departments and agencies and their agency heads as Defendants. The Plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14210, which ordered agencies across the federal government to engage in a radical transformation of the federal bureaucracy, including by conducting large-scale Reductions in Force (RIFs), without Congressional authorization. They challenged the executive order and implementing memoranda under the Separation of Powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Susan Illston. On May 1, 2025, plaintiffs filed for a temporary restraining order. After a hearing on May 9, 2025, Judge Illston granted a 14-day temporary restraining order, applicable to the following department:\u00a0\u00a0OMB, OPM, DOGE, USDA, Commerce, Energy, HHS, HUD, Interior, Labor, State, Treasury, Transportation, VA, AmeriCorps, EPA, GSA, NLRB, NSF, SBA, and SSA.\u00a0 The order paused any further reductions in force and compelled speedy limited discovery.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal, and sought a stay pending appellate litigation.\u00a0 The district court declined to enter a stay, and the 9th Circuit set a schedule for briefing to proceed through May 22 (the day before the TRO is set to expire unless extended).\u00a0 On May 16, the government asked the Supreme Court to grant a stay.\n\nBack in the district court, after briefing, on May 22, 2025, Judge Illston granted a preliminary injunction, barring the challenged government actions during the pendency of the litigation. Following the lead of numerous other courts, Judge Illston rejected the arguement that the agencies were acting of their own accord and were not directed by OMB. Judge Illston held the President would exceed his authority by dismantling programs authorized by Congress. The court reasoned that the dramatic staff reductions will render the agencies unable to do what Congress directs the agencies to do. In light of the evidence, Judge Illston held that the plaintiff's were likely to succeed in their claims that the defendants exceeded their statutory and constitutional authority. American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. Supp. 3d, 2025 WL 1358477 (N.D. Cal. 2025). The government filled an appeal and a motion for a stay pending appeal with the 9th Circuit, on May 23.\u00a0 (This mooted the request for a stay of the TRO pending before the Supreme Court, so the government withdrew that request.)\n\nOn May 30, 2025, the 9th Circuit denied a stay of the preliminary injunction, holding in a published opinion by Circuit Judge William A. Fletcher (joined by Circuit Judge Lucy H. Koh) that\u00a0\u00a0\"the government does not 'suffer by a temporary preservation of the status quo,'\" and was likely to lose the case. First looking at jurisdiction, the court found that the plaintiffs' claims were not appropriately channeled through the comprehensive administrative system established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), because the CSRA did not give any administrative tribunal the authority to address broad challenges to the defendants' constitutional and statutory authority to direct large-scale federal reorganizations and reductions in force.\u00a0 On the merits, the court found that neither the Constitution nor any federal statute grants the President the authority to direct the kind of large-scale reorganization of the federal government at issue, noting that the challenged RIFs appear \"inextricably intertwined with broad agency reorganization, which the president undoubtedly cannot undertake without Congress.\" American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. 4th, 2025 WL 1541714 (9th Cir. 2025).  A dissent by Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan countered that Article II of the Constitution vests the President with sufficient authority to cover the challenged conduct.\u00a0 Judge Callahan dissented that the Executive Order and memorandum merely directed agencies to exercise their own lawful statutory authority and that the district court erred by not finding whether specific RIFs would violate statutory mandates or eliminate agencies.\n\nThe government filed a Supreme Court application for a stay on June 2, 2025. The stay application was presented to Justice Kagan. On July 8, the Court granted the stay of the preliminary injunction entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California pending the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and the disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari. The Court reasoned that the executive order and implementing memoranda themselves were likely legal as they only direct agencies to plan reorganizations in force \"consistent with applicable law.\". The Court declined to express a view on the legality of the Agency RIF or Agency RIF and Reorganization Plan (ARRPs) saying that it was outside the scope of the question in front of them.\n\nJustice Jackson dissented from grant of application for stay. She argued that the Court made this determination outside of the facts and evidence necessary to \"responsibly override, reasoned lower court fact-finding.\" Justice Jackson pointed to the District Court's preliminary findings (which were based \"on actual evidence\") and argued that the Supreme Court should have declined to intervene. The Court resting the granting of the stay on the merits of the case was inappropriate because the District Court issued an injunction based on the facts collected. She further argued that the executive order and memorandum themselves were unconstitutional executive action that does not \"rest on any grant of reorganization authority by Congress.\"\n\nIn response to the stay by the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs asked Judge Illston to reconsider the plaintiffs' request that the government turn over the specific agency proposals for reductions-in-force (RIFs). The government asserted that these documents were protected by the deliberative process privilege. However, Judge Illston rejected this argument, finding that the documents were \"likely not pre-decisional and deliberative documents.\" Judge Illston then ordered the government to respond to the plaintiffs' request by July 14, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for an order shortening the government's time to respond to the discovery request for the RIFs and AARPs (from the standard 30 days to 14 days). The government responded by saying that all the plaintiffs' claim were APA claims and thus, there is no basis for any discovery in the adjudication of those claims.\n\nOn July 15, the government moved for a protective order and/or to quash the plaintiffs' request for production of documents. The motion consisted of seven major claims:\n\n\u2022 Discovery is premature because the government still had not responded to the complaint and was planning on moving to dismiss the complaint. The government requested the court rule on the forthcoming motion first before the request for discovery.   \u2022 The government reiterated that it would be inappropriate to grant discovery in the adjudication of an APA claim, particularly before an administrative record is certified.   \u2022 The requested information is not relevant in light of the stay by the Supreme Court.   \u2022 DOGE and United States DOGE services are not agencies that can be sued subject to the APA. The discovery sought against them is without basis.   \u2022 The Request for Production (RFP) 1 seeks documents that should be protected by deliberative process privilege.   \u2022 The plaintiffs' demand for application for waivers of RIF notice periods and all responses by OMB or OPM to those applications are not relevant to the issues before the court.   \u2022 The discovery sought by the plaintiffs is outside the scope of relief the court could grant. The court cannot review the lawfulness of the ARRPs because they are not final agency actions under the APA.\n\nJudge Illston granted this motion in part and denied it in part on July 18. The court reject the government's assertion that the Supreme Court's stay \"ends this case\" because the stay did not reach several claims in the amended complaint. The Supreme Court's decision did not foreclose considerations of the legality of the ARRPs (\"In a concurrence, Justice Sotomayor noted that the Supreme Court's decision allows the district court to consider the legality of the ARRPs in the 'first instance.'\") Judge Illston reiterated that a full review of the ARRPs would \"significantly aid the Court's review of the merits of these APA claims.\" Judge Illston rejected the government's argument that the plaintiffs never challenged any of the ARRPs as being arbitrary and capricious. She argued that the defendants are \" [arguing] essentially that plaintiffs cannot prove their case because plaintiffs do not have the ARRPs because the ARRPs have not been made public.\" Judge Illston held that the Ninth Circuit has consistently recognized \"narrow exceptions\" to the general rule that the reviewal of APA claims are limited to the administrative record. Finally, the court held that even if some material within the ARRPs should be protected by deliberative process privilege, \"the need for accurate fact finding overrides the government's interest in non-disclosure.\"\n\nHowever, at this point, Judge Illston limited the distribution of the ARRPs to the plaintiffs' counsel and the court. The court also allowed the defendants to redact any material addressing union negotiating strategy to the plaintiffs' counsel. The government was ordered to provide the full version to the court and to highlight any redacted material.\n\nThe government filed two motions on July 21: a motion to dismiss and a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The government alleged that in light of the Supreme Court's decision, all the plaintiff's claims fail. This is due to the fact that all the claims in the amended complaint \"depend on the assertion that the Workforce Executive Order, the Workforce Memorandum, or both are unlawful.\" Further, the government alleged that to the extent the complaint challenges the ARPs, the ARPs are not final agency actions subject to review under the APA. The government complains that the allegations regarding the RIFs and the ARPs are speculation about future actions the government will take. In regards to the jurisdiction arguments, the government argued that challenges to the lawfulness of federal agency personnel action are precluded from district court review. The government reasserted its claim that the complaint be dismissed as to DOGE which is an initiative and not an agency that can be sued.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the government filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, seeking review of the court's July 18 discovery order. The district court released a statement in response to augment the appellate record. Judge Illston noted that in the government's application for a stay from the Supreme Court, the U.S. Solicitor General represented that 40 RIFs in 17 agencies were in progress and enjoined. However, in response to the discovery order, the petitioners produced a list of those represented RIFs, and numerous agencies that were not defendants in the case (and therefore, not enjoined by the preliminary injunction) were included in the figure presented to the Supreme Court. Judge Illston highlighted that this is no insignificant discrepancy and she reasserted her previous finding that \"any deliberative process privilege. . .is overridden by 'the need for accurate fact-finding in this litigation.'\"\n\nJudge Illston denied the plaintiffs' request for an order requiring production of the administrative record. The court found that much of the information plaintiffs sought from an administrative record overlapped with other discovery requests that plaintiffs issued and on which the court had already ruled. The court suggested the plaintiffs clarify some of their APA claims to give the government a more \"specific understanding of the challenged final agency actions\" so that the government can be \"expected to produce an administrative record for those actions.\"\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

The discovery sought against them is without basis.   \u2022 The Request for Production (RFP) 1 seeks documents that should be protected by deliberative process privilege.   \u2022 The plaintiffs' demand for application for waivers of RIF notice periods and all responses by OMB or OPM to those applications are not relevant to the issues before the court.   \u2022 The discovery sought by the plaintiffs is outside the scope of relief the court could grant. The court cannot review the lawfulness of the ARRPs because they are not final agency actions under the APA.\n\nJudge Illston granted this motion in part and denied it in part on July 18. The court reject the government's assertion that the Supreme Court's stay \"ends this case\" because the stay did not reach several claims in the amended complaint. The Supreme Court's decision did not foreclose considerations of the legality of the ARRPs (\"In a concurrence, Justice Sotomayor noted that the Supreme Court's decision allows the district court to consider the legality of the ARRPs in the 'first instance.'\") Judge Illston reiterated that a full review of the ARRPs would \"significantly aid the Court's review of the merits of these APA claims.\" Judge Illston rejected the government's argument that the plaintiffs never challenged any of the ARRPs as being arbitrary and capricious. She argued that the defendants are \" [arguing] essentially that plaintiffs cannot prove their case because plaintiffs do not have the ARRPs because the ARRPs have not been made public.\" Judge Illston held that the Ninth Circuit has consistently recognized \"narrow exceptions\" to the general rule that the reviewal of APA claims are limited to the administrative record. Finally, the court held that even if some material within the ARRPs should be protected by deliberative process privilege, \"the need for accurate fact finding overrides the government's interest in non-disclosure.\"\n\nHowever, at this point, Judge Illston limited the distribution of the ARRPs to the plaintiffs' counsel and the court. The court also allowed the defendants to redact any material addressing union negotiating strategy to the plaintiffs' counsel. The government was ordered to provide the full version to the court and to highlight any redacted material.\n\nThe government filed two motions on July 21: a motion to dismiss and a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The government alleged that in light of the Supreme Court's decision, all the plaintiff's claims fail. This is due to the fact that all the claims in the amended complaint \"depend on the assertion that the Workforce Executive Order, the Workforce Memorandum, or both are unlawful.\" Further, the government alleged that to the extent the complaint challenges the ARPs, the ARPs are not final agency actions subject to review under the APA. The government complains that the allegations regarding the RIFs and the ARPs are speculation about future actions the government will take. In regards to the jurisdiction arguments, the government argued that challenges to the lawfulness of federal agency personnel action are precluded from district court review. The government reasserted its claim that the complaint be dismissed as to DOGE which is an initiative and not an agency that can be sued.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the government filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, seeking review of the court's July 18 discovery order. The district court released a statement in response to augment the appellate record. Judge Illston noted that in the government's application for a stay from the Supreme Court, the U.S. Solicitor General represented that 40 RIFs in 17 agencies were in progress and enjoined. However, in response to the discovery order, the petitioners produced a list of those represented RIFs, and numerous agencies that were not defendants in the case (and therefore, not enjoined by the preliminary injunction) were included in the figure presented to the Supreme Court. Judge Illston highlighted that this is no insignificant discrepancy and she reasserted her previous finding that \"any deliberative process privilege. . .is overridden by 'the need for accurate fact-finding in this litigation.'\"\n\nJudge Illston denied the plaintiffs' request for an order requiring production of the administrative record. The court found that much of the information plaintiffs sought from an administrative record overlapped with other discovery requests that plaintiffs issued and on which the court had already ruled. The court suggested the plaintiffs clarify some of their APA claims to give the government a more \"specific understanding of the challenged final agency actions\" so that the government can be \"expected to produce an administrative record for those actions.\"\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "On April 28, 2025, the American Federation of Government Employees and several other labor organizations, nonprofits, and cities/counties filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. They named President Donald Trump and numerous federal departments and agencies and their agency heads as Defendants. The Plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14210, which ordered agencies across the federal government to engage in a radical transformation of the federal bureaucracy, including by conducting large-scale Reductions in Force (RIFs), without Congressional authorization. They challenged the executive order and implementing memoranda under the Separation of Powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Susan Illston. On May 1, 2025, plaintiffs filed for a temporary restraining order. After a hearing on May 9, 2025, Judge Illston granted a 14-day temporary restraining order, applicable to the following department:\u00a0\u00a0OMB, OPM, DOGE, USDA, Commerce, Energy, HHS, HUD, Interior, Labor, State, Treasury, Transportation, VA, AmeriCorps, EPA, GSA, NLRB, NSF, SBA, and SSA.\u00a0 The order paused any further reductions in force and compelled speedy limited discovery.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal, and sought a stay pending appellate litigation.\u00a0 The district court declined to enter a stay, and the 9th Circuit set a schedule for briefing to proceed through May 22 (the day before the TRO is set to expire unless extended).\u00a0 On May 16, the government asked the Supreme Court to grant a stay.\n\nBack in the district court, after briefing, on May 22, 2025, Judge Illston granted a preliminary injunction, barring the challenged government actions during the pendency of the litigation. Following the lead of numerous other courts, Judge Illston rejected the arguement that the agencies were acting of their own accord and were not directed by OMB. Judge Illston held the President would exceed his authority by dismantling programs authorized by Congress. The court reasoned that the dramatic staff reductions will render the agencies unable to do what Congress directs the agencies to do. In light of the evidence, Judge Illston held that the plaintiff's were likely to succeed in their claims that the defendants exceeded their statutory and constitutional authority. American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. Supp. 3d, 2025 WL 1358477 (N.D. Cal. 2025). The government filled an appeal and a motion for a stay pending appeal with the 9th Circuit, on May 23.\u00a0 (This mooted the request for a stay of the TRO pending before the Supreme Court, so the government withdrew that request.)\n\nOn May 30, 2025, the 9th Circuit denied a stay of the preliminary injunction, holding in a published opinion by Circuit Judge William A. Fletcher (joined by Circuit Judge Lucy H. Koh) that\u00a0\u00a0\"the government does not 'suffer by a temporary preservation of the status quo,'\" and was likely to lose the case. First looking at jurisdiction, the court found that the plaintiffs' claims were not appropriately channeled through the comprehensive administrative system established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), because the CSRA did not give any administrative tribunal the authority to address broad challenges to the defendants' constitutional and statutory authority to direct large-scale federal reorganizations and reductions in force.\u00a0 On the merits, the court found that neither the Constitution nor any federal statute grants the President the authority to direct the kind of large-scale reorganization of the federal government at issue, noting that the challenged RIFs appear \"inextricably intertwined with broad agency reorganization, which the president undoubtedly cannot undertake without Congress.\" American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. 4th, 2025 WL 1541714 (9th Cir. 2025).  A dissent by Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan countered that Article II of the Constitution vests the President with sufficient authority to cover the challenged conduct.\u00a0 Judge Callahan dissented that the Executive Order and memorandum merely directed agencies to exercise their own lawful statutory authority and that the district court erred by not finding whether specific RIFs would violate statutory mandates or eliminate agencies.\n\nThe government filed a Supreme Court application for a stay on June 2, 2025. The stay application was presented to Justice Kagan. On July 8, the Court granted the stay of the preliminary injunction entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California pending the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and the disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari. The Court reasoned that the executive order and implementing memoranda themselves were likely legal as they only direct agencies to plan reorganizations in force \"consistent with applicable law.\". The Court declined to express a view on the legality of the Agency RIF or Agency RIF and Reorganization Plan (ARRPs) saying that it was outside the scope of the question in front of them.\n\nJustice Jackson dissented from grant of application for stay. She argued that the Court made this determination outside of the facts and evidence necessary to \"responsibly override, reasoned lower court fact-finding.\" Justice Jackson pointed to the District Court's preliminary findings (which were based \"on actual evidence\") and argued that the Supreme Court should have declined to intervene. The Court resting the granting of the stay on the merits of the case was inappropriate because the District Court issued an injunction based on the facts collected. She further argued that the executive order and memorandum themselves were unconstitutional executive action that does not \"rest on any grant of reorganization authority by Congress.\"\n\nIn response to the stay by the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs asked Judge Illston to reconsider the plaintiffs' request that the government turn over the specific agency proposals for reductions-in-force (RIFs). The government asserted that these documents were protected by the deliberative process privilege. However, Judge Illston rejected this argument, finding that the documents were \"likely not pre-decisional and deliberative documents.\" Judge Illston then ordered the government to respond to the plaintiffs' request by July 14, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for an order shortening the government's time to respond to the discovery request for the RIFs and AARPs (from the standard 30 days to 14 days). The government responded by saying that all the plaintiffs' claim were APA claims and thus, there is no basis for any discovery in the adjudication of those claims.\n\nOn July 15, the government moved for a protective order and/or to quash the plaintiffs' request for production of documents. The motion consisted of seven major claims:\n\n\u2022 Discovery is premature because the government still had not responded to the complaint and was planning on moving to dismiss the complaint. The government requested the court rule on the forthcoming motion first before the request for discovery.   \u2022 The government reiterated that it would be inappropriate to grant discovery in the adjudication of an APA claim, particularly before an administrative record is certified.   \u2022 The requested information is not relevant in light of the stay by the Supreme Court.   \u2022 DOGE and United States DOGE services are not agencies that can be sued subject to the APA.

The Court resting the granting of the stay on the merits of the case was inappropriate because the District Court issued an injunction based on the facts collected. She further argued that the executive order and memorandum themselves were unconstitutional executive action that does not \"rest on any grant of reorganization authority by Congress.\"\n\nIn response to the stay by the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs asked Judge Illston to reconsider the plaintiffs' request that the government turn over the specific agency proposals for reductions-in-force (RIFs). The government asserted that these documents were protected by the deliberative process privilege. However, Judge Illston rejected this argument, finding that the documents were \"likely not pre-decisional and deliberative documents.\" Judge Illston then ordered the government to respond to the plaintiffs' request by July 14, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for an order shortening the government's time to respond to the discovery request for the RIFs and AARPs (from the standard 30 days to 14 days). The government responded by saying that all the plaintiffs' claim were APA claims and thus, there is no basis for any discovery in the adjudication of those claims.\n\nOn July 15, the government moved for a protective order and/or to quash the plaintiffs' request for production of documents. The motion consisted of seven major claims:\n\n\u2022 Discovery is premature because the government still had not responded to the complaint and was planning on moving to dismiss the complaint. The government requested the court rule on the forthcoming motion first before the request for discovery.   \u2022 The government reiterated that it would be inappropriate to grant discovery in the adjudication of an APA claim, particularly before an administrative record is certified.   \u2022 The requested information is not relevant in light of the stay by the Supreme Court.   \u2022 DOGE and United States DOGE services are not agencies that can be sued subject to the APA. The discovery sought against them is without basis.   \u2022 The Request for Production (RFP) 1 seeks documents that should be protected by deliberative process privilege.   \u2022 The plaintiffs' demand for application for waivers of RIF notice periods and all responses by OMB or OPM to those applications are not relevant to the issues before the court.   \u2022 The discovery sought by the plaintiffs is outside the scope of relief the court could grant. The court cannot review the lawfulness of the ARRPs because they are not final agency actions under the APA.\n\nJudge Illston granted this motion in part and denied it in part on July 18. The court reject the government's assertion that the Supreme Court's stay \"ends this case\" because the stay did not reach several claims in the amended complaint. The Supreme Court's decision did not foreclose considerations of the legality of the ARRPs (\"In a concurrence, Justice Sotomayor noted that the Supreme Court's decision allows the district court to consider the legality of the ARRPs in the 'first instance.'\") Judge Illston reiterated that a full review of the ARRPs would \"significantly aid the Court's review of the merits of these APA claims.\" Judge Illston rejected the government's argument that the plaintiffs never challenged any of the ARRPs as being arbitrary and capricious. She argued that the defendants are \" [arguing] essentially that plaintiffs cannot prove their case because plaintiffs do not have the ARRPs because the ARRPs have not been made public.\" Judge Illston held that the Ninth Circuit has consistently recognized \"narrow exceptions\" to the general rule that the reviewal of APA claims are limited to the administrative record. Finally, the court held that even if some material within the ARRPs should be protected by deliberative process privilege, \"the need for accurate fact finding overrides the government's interest in non-disclosure.\"\n\nHowever, at this point, Judge Illston limited the distribution of the ARRPs to the plaintiffs' counsel and the court. The court also allowed the defendants to redact any material addressing union negotiating strategy to the plaintiffs' counsel. The government was ordered to provide the full version to the court and to highlight any redacted material.\n\nThe government filed two motions on July 21: a motion to dismiss and a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The government alleged that in light of the Supreme Court's decision, all the plaintiff's claims fail. This is due to the fact that all the claims in the amended complaint \"depend on the assertion that the Workforce Executive Order, the Workforce Memorandum, or both are unlawful.\" Further, the government alleged that to the extent the complaint challenges the ARPs, the ARPs are not final agency actions subject to review under the APA. The government complains that the allegations regarding the RIFs and the ARPs are speculation about future actions the government will take. In regards to the jurisdiction arguments, the government argued that challenges to the lawfulness of federal agency personnel action are precluded from district court review. The government reasserted its claim that the complaint be dismissed as to DOGE which is an initiative and not an agency that can be sued.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the government filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, seeking review of the court's July 18 discovery order. The district court released a statement in response to augment the appellate record. Judge Illston noted that in the government's application for a stay from the Supreme Court, the U.S. Solicitor General represented that 40 RIFs in 17 agencies were in progress and enjoined. However, in response to the discovery order, the petitioners produced a list of those represented RIFs, and numerous agencies that were not defendants in the case (and therefore, not enjoined by the preliminary injunction) were included in the figure presented to the Supreme Court. Judge Illston highlighted that this is no insignificant discrepancy and she reasserted her previous finding that \"any deliberative process privilege. . .is overridden by 'the need for accurate fact-finding in this litigation.'\"\n\nJudge Illston denied the plaintiffs' request for an order requiring production of the administrative record. The court found that much of the information plaintiffs sought from an administrative record overlapped with other discovery requests that plaintiffs issued and on which the court had already ruled. The court suggested the plaintiffs clarify some of their APA claims to give the government a more \"specific understanding of the challenged final agency actions\" so that the government can be \"expected to produce an administrative record for those actions.\"\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "target": "On April 28, 2025, the American Federation of Government Employees and several other labor organizations, nonprofits, and cities/counties filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. They named President Donald Trump and numerous federal departments and agencies and their agency heads as Defendants. The Plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14210, which ordered agencies across the federal government to engage in a radical transformation of the federal bureaucracy, including by conducting large-scale Reductions in Force (RIFs), without Congressional authorization. They challenged the executive order and implementing memoranda under the Separation of Powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Susan Illston. On May 1, 2025, plaintiffs filed for a temporary restraining order. After a hearing on May 9, 2025, Judge Illston granted a 14-day temporary restraining order, applicable to the following department:\u00a0\u00a0OMB, OPM, DOGE, USDA, Commerce, Energy, HHS, HUD, Interior, Labor, State, Treasury, Transportation, VA, AmeriCorps, EPA, GSA, NLRB, NSF, SBA, and SSA.\u00a0 The order paused any further reductions in force and compelled speedy limited discovery.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal, and sought a stay pending appellate litigation.\u00a0 The district court declined to enter a stay, and the 9th Circuit set a schedule for briefing to proceed through May 22 (the day before the TRO is set to expire unless extended).\u00a0 On May 16, the government asked the Supreme Court to grant a stay.\n\nBack in the district court, after briefing, on May 22, 2025, Judge Illston granted a preliminary injunction, barring the challenged government actions during the pendency of the litigation. Following the lead of numerous other courts, Judge Illston rejected the arguement that the agencies were acting of their own accord and were not directed by OMB. Judge Illston held the President would exceed his authority by dismantling programs authorized by Congress. The court reasoned that the dramatic staff reductions will render the agencies unable to do what Congress directs the agencies to do. In light of the evidence, Judge Illston held that the plaintiff's were likely to succeed in their claims that the defendants exceeded their statutory and constitutional authority. American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. Supp. 3d, 2025 WL 1358477 (N.D. Cal. 2025). The government filled an appeal and a motion for a stay pending appeal with the 9th Circuit, on May 23.\u00a0 (This mooted the request for a stay of the TRO pending before the Supreme Court, so the government withdrew that request.)\n\nOn May 30, 2025, the 9th Circuit denied a stay of the preliminary injunction, holding in a published opinion by Circuit Judge William A. Fletcher (joined by Circuit Judge Lucy H. Koh) that\u00a0\u00a0\"the government does not 'suffer by a temporary preservation of the status quo,'\" and was likely to lose the case. First looking at jurisdiction, the court found that the plaintiffs' claims were not appropriately channeled through the comprehensive administrative system established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), because the CSRA did not give any administrative tribunal the authority to address broad challenges to the defendants' constitutional and statutory authority to direct large-scale federal reorganizations and reductions in force.\u00a0 On the merits, the court found that neither the Constitution nor any federal statute grants the President the authority to direct the kind of large-scale reorganization of the federal government at issue, noting that the challenged RIFs appear \"inextricably intertwined with broad agency reorganization, which the president undoubtedly cannot undertake without Congress.\" American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. 4th, 2025 WL 1541714 (9th Cir. 2025).  A dissent by Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan countered that Article II of the Constitution vests the President with sufficient authority to cover the challenged conduct.\u00a0 Judge Callahan dissented that the Executive Order and memorandum merely directed agencies to exercise their own lawful statutory authority and that the district court erred by not finding whether specific RIFs would violate statutory mandates or eliminate agencies.\n\nThe government filed a Supreme Court application for a stay on June 2, 2025. The stay application was presented to Justice Kagan. On July 8, the Court granted the stay of the preliminary injunction entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California pending the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and the disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari. The Court reasoned that the executive order and implementing memoranda themselves were likely legal as they only direct agencies to plan reorganizations in force \"consistent with applicable law.\". The Court declined to express a view on the legality of the Agency RIF or Agency RIF and Reorganization Plan (ARRPs) saying that it was outside the scope of the question in front of them.\n\nJustice Jackson dissented from grant of application for stay. She argued that the Court made this determination outside of the facts and evidence necessary to \"responsibly override, reasoned lower court fact-finding.\" Justice Jackson pointed to the District Court's preliminary findings (which were based \"on actual evidence\") and argued that the Supreme Court should have declined to intervene. The Court resting the granting of the stay on the merits of the case was inappropriate because the District Court issued an injunction based on the facts collected. She further argued that the executive order and memorandum themselves were unconstitutional executive action that does not \"rest on any grant of reorganization authority by Congress.\"\n\nIn response to the stay by the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs asked Judge Illston to reconsider the plaintiffs' request that the government turn over the specific agency proposals for reductions-in-force (RIFs).
