    "target": "This case was a highly unusual federal criminal prosecution of a sitting state court judge\u2014who was alleged by the Trump Administration to have interfered with an immigration arrest. On April 24, 2025, a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Wisconsin indicted Wisconsin Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan on two counts: (1) obstruction of a federal administrative proceeding under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505, and (2) concealment of a person from arrest under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman and referred for pretrial matters to Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Judge Dugan, while presiding over her courtroom in Milwaukee County Circuit Court on March 14, took steps to prevent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers' arrest of a noncitizen criminal defendant under an immigration detainer. Federal prosecutors alleged that she challenged the agents\u2019 authority, directed them to speak with the chief judge, resumed the hearing off the record, and permitted the defendant to leave through a secure non-public exit. The government contended that these actions constituted deliberate obstruction of lawful federal enforcement efforts.\n\nJudge Dugan moved to dismiss the indictment on May 14. Represented by former U.S. attorneys and experienced criminal defense counsel, she argued that her alleged conduct was fully within the scope of her judicial duties and was protected by absolute judicial immunity. She contended that the charges violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers, the Tenth Amendment\u2019s federalism protections, and the longstanding principle that judicial acts\u2014especially those involving courtroom management\u2014cannot be criminalized. Her briefing drew heavily from Trump v. United States (2024), where the Supreme Court held that the President cannot be prosecuted for official acts, and argued that the same logic applied to judges. She also invoked constitutional avoidance and argued that the relevant criminal statutes could not be construed to reach judicial conduct without raising serious constitutional questions.\n\nAmici curiae briefs were filed on both sides. A coalition of 138 former federal and state judges moved to support dismissal, emphasizing the risk of chilling judicial independence and public trust. They argued that courtroom decision-making must be insulated from criminal sanction, and that accountability for judges is properly handled through appeal or state judicial conduct commissions. In response, the Center for American Rights filed an amicus brief arguing that public officials\u2014judges included\u2014are not immune from prosecution for obstructing justice, and that allowing immunity here would set a dangerous precedent.\n\nOn July 7, Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph issued a Report and Recommendation that recommended that the court deny the motion to dismiss. She concluded that no federal court had recognized absolute judicial immunity as a bar to criminal prosecution, rather than civil liability. While the alleged conduct may have occurred near or within the courtroom, she found that whether it was \"judicial in nature\" and immune from prosecution was not a question that could be resolved on the pleadings. The Report emphasized that judges have historically been held criminally liable for corruption or obstruction where warranted, citing precedents such as United States v. Claiborne and United States v. Joseph. She recommended that the case proceed to trial, with the motion to dismiss denied in full.\n\nOn July 22, Judge Dugan filed objections to the Report and Recommendation, reiterating her constitutional arguments and asserting that the magistrate failed to address controlling authority on judicial independence. On July 29, the government filed its response, urging the district court to adopt the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and allow the case to proceed to trial.\n\nAs of August 4, 2025, the district judge had not yet ruled on the motion to dismiss. The case is ongoing.",

    "target": "This case was a highly unusual federal criminal prosecution of a sitting state court judge\u2014who was alleged by the Trump Administration to have interfered with an immigration arrest. On April 24, 2025, a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Wisconsin indicted Wisconsin Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan on two counts: (1) obstruction of a federal administrative proceeding under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505, and (2) concealment of a person from arrest under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman and referred for pretrial matters to Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Judge Dugan, while presiding over her courtroom in Milwaukee County Circuit Court on March 14, took steps to prevent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers' arrest of a noncitizen criminal defendant under an immigration detainer. Federal prosecutors alleged that she challenged the agents\u2019 authority, directed them to speak with the chief judge, resumed the hearing off the record, and permitted the defendant to leave through a secure non-public exit. The government contended that these actions constituted deliberate obstruction of lawful federal enforcement efforts.\n\nJudge Dugan moved to dismiss the indictment on May 14. Represented by former U.S. attorneys and experienced criminal defense counsel, she argued that her alleged conduct was fully within the scope of her judicial duties and was protected by absolute judicial immunity. She contended that the charges violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers, the Tenth Amendment\u2019s federalism protections, and the longstanding principle that judicial acts\u2014especially those involving courtroom management\u2014cannot be criminalized.

    "target": "This case was a highly unusual federal criminal prosecution of a sitting state court judge\u2014who was alleged by the Trump Administration to have interfered with an immigration arrest. On April 24, 2025, a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Wisconsin indicted Wisconsin Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan on two counts: (1) obstruction of a federal administrative proceeding under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505, and (2) concealment of a person from arrest under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman and referred for pretrial matters to Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Judge Dugan, while presiding over her courtroom in Milwaukee County Circuit Court on March 14, took steps to prevent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers' arrest of a noncitizen criminal defendant under an immigration detainer. Federal prosecutors alleged that she challenged the agents\u2019 authority, directed them to speak with the chief judge, resumed the hearing off the record, and permitted the defendant to leave through a secure non-public exit. The government contended that these actions constituted deliberate obstruction of lawful federal enforcement efforts.\n\nJudge Dugan moved to dismiss the indictment on May 14. Represented by former U.S. attorneys and experienced criminal defense counsel, she argued that her alleged conduct was fully within the scope of her judicial duties and was protected by absolute judicial immunity. She contended that the charges violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers, the Tenth Amendment\u2019s federalism protections, and the longstanding principle that judicial acts\u2014especially those involving courtroom management\u2014cannot be criminalized. Her briefing drew heavily from Trump v. United States (2024), where the Supreme Court held that the President cannot be prosecuted for official acts, and argued that the same logic applied to judges. She also invoked constitutional avoidance and argued that the relevant criminal statutes could not be construed to reach judicial conduct without raising serious constitutional questions.\n\nAmici curiae briefs were filed on both sides. A coalition of 138 former federal and state judges moved to support dismissal, emphasizing the risk of chilling judicial independence and public trust. They argued that courtroom decision-making must be insulated from criminal sanction, and that accountability for judges is properly handled through appeal or state judicial conduct commissions. In response, the Center for American Rights filed an amicus brief arguing that public officials\u2014judges included\u2014are not immune from prosecution for obstructing justice, and that allowing immunity here would set a dangerous precedent.\n\nOn July 7, Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph issued a Report and Recommendation that recommended that the court deny the motion to dismiss. She concluded that no federal court had recognized absolute judicial immunity as a bar to criminal prosecution, rather than civil liability. While the alleged conduct may have occurred near or within the courtroom, she found that whether it was \"judicial in nature\" and immune from prosecution was not a question that could be resolved on the pleadings. The Report emphasized that judges have historically been held criminally liable for corruption or obstruction where warranted, citing precedents such as United States v. Claiborne and United States v. Joseph. She recommended that the case proceed to trial, with the motion to dismiss denied in full.\n\nOn July 22, Judge Dugan filed objections to the Report and Recommendation, reiterating her constitutional arguments and asserting that the magistrate failed to address controlling authority on judicial independence. On July 29, the government filed its response, urging the district court to adopt the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and allow the case to proceed to trial.\n\nAs of August 4, 2025, the district judge had not yet ruled on the motion to dismiss. The case is ongoing.",
