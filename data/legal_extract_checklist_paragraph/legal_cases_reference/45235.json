(Plaintiff), a non-profit charitable corporation dedicated to helping the homeless, brought this lawsuit on December 21, 2023 against Columbia County, Florida (defendant) in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. The plaintiff challenged Columbia County Ordinance NO. 2022-03 (the ordinance), which prohibited solicitation and loitering within or upon any county building or the curtilage of those buildings. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the ordinance violated the First Amendment because it was an overbroad restriction on speech in traditional public fora. Additionally, the plaintiff claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiff sought a declaration that the ordinance violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments, both facially and as-applied, a preliminary and permanent injunction against enforcement of the ordinance, all damages permitted by law, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Marcia Morales Howard.\n\nOn December 22, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. On January 24, 2024, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss. Two days later, the court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that the plaintiff was substantially likely to succeed on the merits regarding both the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment claims, and it enjoined the defendant from enforcing the ordinance. The court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion in any other respects.\n\nOn June 28, 2024, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment. After the defendant asked for an extension to file a response to the plaintiff\u2019s motion, the defendant filed a notice of settlement on September 27, 2024. The parties subsequently filed a stipulation of dismissal, and the court dismissed the case with prejudice on October 24, 2024. The terms of the settlement were not made public. The case is now closed.",

    "target": "The Cosac Foundation, Inc. (Plaintiff), a non-profit charitable corporation dedicated to helping the homeless, brought this lawsuit on December 21, 2023 against Columbia County, Florida (defendant) in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. The plaintiff challenged Columbia County Ordinance NO. 2022-03 (the ordinance), which prohibited solicitation and loitering within or upon any county building or the curtilage of those buildings. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the ordinance violated the First Amendment because it was an overbroad restriction on speech in traditional public fora. Additionally, the plaintiff claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiff sought a declaration that the ordinance violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments, both facially and as-applied, a preliminary and permanent injunction against enforcement of the ordinance, all damages permitted by law, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Marcia Morales Howard.\n\nOn December 22, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. On January 24, 2024, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss. Two days later, the court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that the plaintiff was substantially likely to succeed on the merits regarding both the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment claims, and it enjoined the defendant from enforcing the ordinance. The court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion in any other respects.\n\nOn June 28, 2024, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment. After the defendant asked for an extension to file a response to the plaintiff\u2019s motion, the defendant filed a notice of settlement on September 27, 2024. The parties subsequently filed a stipulation of dismissal, and the court dismissed the case with prejudice on October 24, 2024. The terms of the settlement were not made public. The case is now closed.",
